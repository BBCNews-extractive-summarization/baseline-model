Controversial new UK casinos will be banned from using American tricks of the trade to ensure they are "socially responsible", it has been suggested. She told The Times: "British casinos will be quite different to those overseas. "They will be run according to British rules and we'll simply not allow any tricks which people are subjected to unawares and which increase the risk of problem gambling." One tactic used in the US is simulating daylight during night-time to lull players into remaining at the tables and slot machines. Casinos also frequently offer free food, drink and hotel accommodation to keep punters betting. A spokesman for the British Casino Association, which represents the UK industry, said the government was trying to allay fears over a "UK Las Vegas". "The UK gambling industry is being totally frozen in time, and the foreign companies will take over."
