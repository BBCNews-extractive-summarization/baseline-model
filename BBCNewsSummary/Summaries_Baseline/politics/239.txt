The Police Federation has said it strongly opposes giving Community Support Officers (CSOs) the power to detain suspects for up to 30 minutes. The powers - piloted in six areas - were extended to all police forces in England and Wales on Thursday. Police Federation chairman Jan Berry said civilian officers should act as "eyes and ears" for the police. CSOs can now use reasonable force to detain suspects for up to 30 minutes while they wait for police officers to arrive. The powers will be granted by chief constables of local forces. Ms Blears said the study shows CSOs are "making a real difference" in the fight against crime. "While the answer is a lot more real police, the government wants to recruit 25,000 people who can't arrest anyone," he said. They already have powers to hand out fines for a wide range of offences. The Serious Organised Crime and Police Bill proposes extra powers to search suspects, enforce licensing offences, direct traffic and deter begging.
