The "myth that ageing is a barrier" to contributing to society needs to be "exploded", the work and pensions minister has said. This was why the government was considering scrapping the retirement age entirely, Alan Johnson said. Mr Johnson told Age Concern's Age Agenda in London the government was "seriously considering" introducing pensions based on residency rather than national insurance contributions. Mr Johnson's speech comes after he last week unveiled plans to find a consensus on how to reform the country's pension system. Speaking at the London conference he said: "Generalised stereotypes of people past state pension age as dependant, incapable and vulnerable are a particularly pernicious form of age discrimination". "And the review in 2011, which will look at whether it is time to sweep retirement ages away entirely, is to be tied to evidence ... showing that retirement ages are increasingly outmoded".
