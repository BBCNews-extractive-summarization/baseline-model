MPs will be thrown out of the Commons if they use Blackberries in the chamber Speaker Michael Martin has ruled. The devices gained new prominence this week after Alastair Campbell used his to accidentally send an expletive-laden message to a Newsnight journalist.

The sound of a mobile phone or a pager can result in a strong rebuke from either the Speaker or his deputies.
