The UK Independence Party has lost one of its two London Assembly members to Robert Kilroy-Silk's new political party, expected to launch on Wednesday. Sources close to Mr Hockney said around eight other members of London UKIP were also planning to jump ship. The news came after UKIP suspended a candidate for allegedly suggesting the criminally insane should be killed. A spokesman for UKIP called on Mr Hockney to quit the London Assembly. UKIP asserts that Mr Hockney "has a moral obligation, if not a legal one" to stand down. On the suspension of Mr Houston, UKIP said those who selected him knew nothing of his views. UKIP spokesman Mark Croucher said the main issue would be that Mr Houston's reported views had been presented as UKIP policy, which they were not.
