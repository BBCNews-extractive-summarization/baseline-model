Deaths in custody have reached "shocking" levels, a committee of MPs and peers has warned. The joint committee on human rights found those committing suicide were mainly the most vulnerable, with mental health, drugs or alcohol problems. Members urged the government to set up a task force to tackle deaths in prisons, police cells, detention centres and special hospitals. There was one prison suicide every four days between 1999 and 2003, MPs said. The report, which followed a year-long inquiry by the committee, found the high death rate "amounts to a serious failure to protect the right to life of a highly vulnerable group". Committee chairman Labour MP Jean Corston said: "Each and every death in custody is a death too many, regardless of the circumstances. "Yet throughout our inquiry we have seen time and time again that extremely vulnerable people are entering custody with a history of mental illness, drug and alcohol problems and potential for taking their own lives." "Crime levels are falling but we are holding more people in custody than ever before. Between 1990 and 2004, 25 children have taken their own lives in prison and two have died in secure training centres.
