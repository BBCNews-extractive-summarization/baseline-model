Visa processing staff are sometimes expected to rule on an application every 11 minutes, MPs have said. Every officer had an annual target of 8,000 applications - equivalent to 40 a day or one every 11 minutes. Committee chairman Edward Leigh said: "There is a worrying tension between quick processing and proper control over the visas issued. "Entry clearance staff are expected to deal with a visa application in about 11 minutes which is surely too little time to look closely at the supporting documents. " Investigations carried out in the wake of Ms Hughes' resignation found more than 7,000 people had entered the UK under the business visa scheme for Romanian and Bulgarian "entrepreneurs".
