The Labour Party will hold its 2006 autumn conference in Manchester and not Blackpool, it has been confirmed. It will be the first time since 1917 that the party has chosen Manchester to host the annual event. For years the main political parties have rotated between Blackpool, Bournemouth and Brighton. I just hope Manchester can handle the crowds. "It amazes me that the Labour Party, which is a working class party, doesn't want to come to the main working class resort in the country." The exact cost to Blackpool in terms of lost revenue for hotel accommodation is not yet known but it is thought that block bookings will be taken at the major Manchester hotels after the official announcement.
