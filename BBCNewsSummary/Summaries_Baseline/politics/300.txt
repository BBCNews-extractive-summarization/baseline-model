Michael Howard has denied his shadow cabinet was split over its decision to back controversial Labour plans to introduce ID cards. Tory sources say senior party figures had argued vociferously against the ID card scheme. But Mr Howard denied Mr Yeo, his transport and environment spokesman, said the plans "stink". Mr Howard said the police had said ID cards could "help them foil a terror bomb plot in which people could lose their lives". He acknowledged there were "good libertarian arguments" against the cards, but said the shadow Cabinet had weighed up all the "conflicting interests" before reaching its decision. He also denied he was afraid of looking "soft" on the issue, compared to Labour. Sources within the party told the BBC Mr Howard had always been in favour of ID cards, and tried to introduce them when he was Home Secretary. Lib Dem home affairs spokesman Mark Oaten has branded the ID scheme a waste of money and "deeply flawed". He said: "This has all the signs of Michael Howard overruling colleagues' concerns over ID cards." If they haven't [ID cards] they are going to be detained." Tory ex-minister Douglas Hogg said he opposed the plans for ID cards branding them a "regressive" step which would intrude into the lives of ordinary citizens without any counterbalancing benefits.
