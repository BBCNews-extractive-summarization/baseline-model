New powers are needed to close disorderly pubs, bars and clubs for up to a week or even permanently, police chiefs have told MPs. Association of Chief Police Officers president Chris Fox said the current 24-hour closure power did not have enough impact on bad landlords. Mr Fox's comments follow the controversy over plans to allow pubs to open around the clock. Acpo made its call for stronger closure powers in a paper for the Commons home affairs select committee. The new licensing laws will give police greater powers to close pubs and clubs - but only for 24-hour periods. Mr Fox said the new laws, due to start being phased in next month, could help if food outlets, public transport and public toilets could cope with late-night drinkers. "Staggering it (closing hours) will be a solution if the infrastructure is there, if the premises are properly managed and people aren't being served rolling drunk and underage and then tossed out into the street," he said. Acpo wants pubs and clubs which cause extra work for police and hospitals to have to pay towards the costs. The licensing changes have sparked concern among some MPs, councils and some senior police officers who fear they could exacerbate drinking problems. Leaked documents have suggested ex-Home Secretary David Blunkett branded new opening hours as a "leap in the dark". The police's job against alcohol-related crime would be made easier if all pubs did not close at the same time, she added.
