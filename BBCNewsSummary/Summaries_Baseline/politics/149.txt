Prime Minister Tony Blair has arrived back from his diplomatic mission to the Middle East to try to resurrect the peace process. Mr Blair held talks with his Israeli counterpart, Ariel Sharon, and the Palestinian leader, Mahmoud Abbas. Mr Blair also made a surprise trip to Iraq this week. Mr Blair briefly visited the tomb of Yasser Arafat in Ramallah - the first world leader to do so. At a news conference following talks with Mr Blair, Mr Abbas said the British prime minister was "in a unique position to help us progress in our peaceful pursuit". Mr Blair acknowledged some people believed he was too close to the Israelis, but said the Israelis were entitled to expect Palestinians to give up terrorism. Before visiting Israel, Mr Blair made a surprise visit to Iraq, where he met leaders in Baghdad during his first trip to the city.
