Civil servants have drastically stepped up the shredding of official documents, figures compiled by the Tories suggest. But the Tories want the information commissioner to investigate. But BBC Political Correspondent James Hardy said the prospect of outsiders poking their noses into the inner workings of Whitehall appeared to be causing jitters among the mandarins. Liberal Democrat Alan Beith - who chairs the select committee which monitors the Department of Constitutional Affairs - said if the claims were true, Whitehall was "acting entirely against the spirit of the new Act". Fellow Lib Dem Norman Baker said the episode painted an "unflattering picture of the inner workings of government". Dr Julian Lewis, the Conservative spokesman for the Cabinet Office, said he had discovered a huge acceleration in shredding from a series of parliamentary answers. The Department of Work and Pensions destroyed nearly 37,000 files last year - up 22,000 on four years ago when the Act was passed. Earlier this week, Mr Thomas said he was looking into Cabinet Office orders telling staff to delete e-mails more than three months old. Government guidance said e-mails should only be deleted if they served "no current purpose", Mr Thomas said.
