EU member states are failing to report fraud and irregularities in EU funds on a consistent basis, the UK's public spending watchdog has said. The National Audit Office said although the latest figures showed reported fraud was falling, the EU still had no common definition of fraud. The NAO urged the government to push for improvements in reporting fraud. It said there were 922 cases of reported fraud or irregularities in EU funds in the UK in 2003, worth £38.5m (52m euros), up from 831 cases worth £35.7m in 2002. At the same time, reported fraud throughout the EU dropped from 10,276 cases worth £808m to 8,177 cases worth £644m. "Any fraud in other member states is potentially fraud against the UK taxpayer, given that we are the second largest net contributor to the Community," he said. A spokesman for the European Anti-Fraud Office said the organisation agreed with the NAO's assessment of fraud reporting.
