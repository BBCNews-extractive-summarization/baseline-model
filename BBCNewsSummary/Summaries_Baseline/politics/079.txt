The risk of pets and children being given votes could be cut by changing how people register to vote, the UK elections watchdog has said. The Electoral Commission says enabling people to register individually could cut some errors and combat fraud. Voters need to register by 11 March if the next poll is on 5 May as expected. The Electoral Commission says having voters register individually rather than the head of household do it for them fits better with human rights laws. Chairman Sam Younger told MPs on Tuesday care was needed to ensure that people were not lost off the register in the process - which happened when Northern Ireland switched to a similar system. There have been rare cases when household pets have been put on the electoral roll, the MPs heard. Mr Younger said using the Royal Mail's postal redirection service had already helped election officers retrace about 50,000 voters. There have been fears there are too few checks to ensure current postal votes are cast by the person on the voting form. Currently, British voters have to re-register to vote every year or face being removed from the electoral rolls if they fail to do so two years running.
