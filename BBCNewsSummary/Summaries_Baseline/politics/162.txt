The government should change the law to give more protection to employees who raise health and safety concerns about their workplaces, the TUC has said. It said data from employment tribunals suggested 1,500 "safety whistleblowers" had lost their jobs since 1999. General secretary Brendan Barber said: "It shouldn't be a firing offence to object to unsafe work. Mr Barber, who said the "problem is far worse than official statistics show", called for a legal system that "protects safety whistleblowers". He added that workers who are not in a union, as well as casual and migrant workers, "stand little chance of redress." Rory O' Neill, editor of union-backed Hazards magazine, which conducted the research, said: "Giving union safety reps more rights in more workplaces is the ultimate win-win. The TUC has called on the government to appoint "roving" safety reps and to increase spending on health and safety work inspections.
