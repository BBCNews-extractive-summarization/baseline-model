Broadcasters should fix a date for a pre-election televised debate between the three main political leaders, according to the Hansard Society. "The broadcasters should make the decision to go ahead," he said. Lord Holme's proposal for a televised debate comes just four months after millions of viewers were able to watch US President George W Bush slug it out verbally with his Democratic challenger John Kerry. If Mr Blair did not want to take part, the broadcasters could go ahead with an empty chair or cancel the event and explain their reasons why, Lord Holme said. Lord Holme, who has campaigned for televised debates at previous elections, said broadcasters were "more than willing to cooperate with the arrangements". Opinion polls suggested that the idea had the backing of the public who like comparing the personalities and policies of the contenders in their own homes, he said. Lord Holme argued that as part of their public service obligations, broadcasters "should make the decision to go ahead" as soon as the election is called. "It would be up to each party leader to accept or refuse," said Lord Holme. Tony Blair has already ruled out taking part in a televised debate during the forthcoming election campaign.
