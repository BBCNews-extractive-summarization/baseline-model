Reports that Tony Blair is planning a snap general election for February 2005 have been described as "idle speculation" by Downing Street. The papers suggest ministers believe the government could benefit from a "Baghdad bounce" following successful Iraq elections in January. Harold Wilson took over and increased his majority later in the year in a second election

The latest speculation suggests the prime minister favours a February poll in order to exploit his current opinion poll lead over Conservative leader Michael Howard. A Labour Party spokesman said the election date was ultimately a matter for Mr Blair, but he was unaware of anything to suggest it would be in February. Most commentators have been expecting an election on 5 May.
