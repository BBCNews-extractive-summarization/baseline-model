Local communities would be asked to go to the polls to elect their own area police commissioner, under plans unveiled by the Conservatives. Party leader Michael Howard said the new role would replace "inconspicuous" police authorities. The Lib Dems said the plan could let extreme groups run policing, while Labour criticised "extravagant" Tory promises on policing. Outlining his crime manifesto, Mr Howard said elected police commissioners would be more accountable than police authorities which are made up of local councillors and magistrates. Lord Harris, who sits on the executive of Association of Police Authorities, said the plans seemed to suggest chief constables should be told what to do by a single politician. Liberal Democrat home affairs spokesman Mark Oaten said the plan was dangerous and "could create conflict between chief constables and elected officials". Mr Oaten said local people had too little control over policing but a far better solution would be for elected councillors to draw up a "minimum policing guarantee" with their chief constables. He said: "Today the Tories are making more extravagant promises on the police without making clear how they would pay for them, other than through fantasy savings to the asylum system." Other Tory law and order plans include building more prisons and making criminals serve full jail sentences.
