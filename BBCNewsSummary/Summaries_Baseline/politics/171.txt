Children would be offered two hours' free sports training a week by a future Tory government, the party has said. The Club2School policy would provide up to £250m yearly for local sports clubs in the UK to deliver after-school sport. "We aim to shift the emphasis on after-school sport provision away from our overstretched teachers and schools directly in to the 151,000 sports clubs in the UK." The Tories say Labour's plans to give all children two hours of sports lessons a week in schools have failed. The Tories also claim that of the £750m the prime minister pledged in 2000 to invest on school sports facilities, only £41m had been spent.
