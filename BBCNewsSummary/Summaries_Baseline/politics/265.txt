Plans to abolish 162 quangos have been unveiled by the Conservatives as part of their effort to show how government red tape can be cut. Six government units would also be scrapped under proposals which the Tories say would save more than £4.3bn. Tory frontbencher John Redwood said Britain needed a slimmer government and lower taxes to be competitive. Announcing the plans, Mr Redwood said: "Mr Blair has forgotten the interests of taxpayers, and has broken the pledges he made. "Labour are creating Two Britains: the Britain of the forgotten majority and bureaucratic Britain," he said. The forgotten majority are paying the price of bureaucratic Britain." But Chief Secretary to the Treasury Paul Boateng attacked the Tory plans. "The Conservatives are committed to cutting Labour's public spending plans by a massive £35 billion," he said. The Liberal Democrats have said they would cut the number of Whitehall departments to make sure money reaches frontline services.
