Tory delegates are gathering for what is expected to be their last conference before the general election, declaring Britain needs "a change at the top". The party goes into its spring forum trying to highlight what it sees as a clear choice between it and Labour. Tory co-chairman Liam Fox has opened proceedings with a speech criticising Tony Blair's record in government. Dr Fox also underlined Tory promises to cut tax by Â£4bn. BBC political correspondent Shaun Ley says opinion polls suggest the Tories still lag some way behind Labour on the issues of health, education and the economy.
