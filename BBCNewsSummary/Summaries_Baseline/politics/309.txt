The majority of young people are interested in politics, holding "strong opinions" on policies and have a "keen appetite" for direct action. Mock elections are planned to take place in schools across the UK. Electoral Commission boss Sam Younger said: "We know that young people often feel disengaged from democratic life and we believe in working creatively to encourage their interest and participation. The survey of a sample of 500 British 16 to 20-year-olds and 500 21 to 25-year olds "showed Britain's young people are far from apathetic about issues that matter to most of their lives".
