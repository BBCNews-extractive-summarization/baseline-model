David Blunkett has apologised to MPs after the Home Office announced "prematurely" via press release a review of murder laws. The home secretary confirmed the review was to get under way in the wake of a Law Commission report which branded the current murder law as "a mess". News of the review was released because it was thought Mr Blunkett would make the official announcement in a Commons debate on Wednesday. Amid opposition anger, Mr Blunkett had to answer an emergency question in Parliament on Thursday. In its report, the Law Commission said it had found wide support among criminal justice professionals for an end to the mandatory life sentence for murder. A key question was whether one category should continue to cover all types of murder from mercy killings to serial or contract killings. The commission found support for the idea of grading murders so that the sentence reflected the seriousness of the offence. But speaking after the report was published, Home Office minister Baroness Scotland said: "Murder is the most serious of crimes and we have no intention of abolishing the mandatory life sentence. "Where an offender is convicted of murder, the court must pass a life sentence."
