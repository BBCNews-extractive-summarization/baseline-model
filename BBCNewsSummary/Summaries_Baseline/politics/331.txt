Labour has been accused of using anti-Semitic images in posters which critics claim depict Tory leader Michael Howard as Fagin. The image prompted concern from the editor of the Jewish Chronicle but Labour insists it is simply anti-Tory. The party will now use focus groups to test a poster showing Mr Howard and shadow chancellor Oliver Letwin with a blackboard reading: "2+2=5". There was controversy over another poster choice offered to Labour members. Mr Howard did not comment on the anti-Semitism claims when asked about the poster on Monday. The poster is among one of a series of ideas shown to Labour members, who have been asked to choose which one should be used ahead of the election. Labour campaign spokesman Fraser Kemp said the poster had been misunderstood. The image simply portrayed Mr Howard as a hypnotist, he argued. A Labour spokesman later said the timing of removing the controversial image from the party's website was not affected by the row. But a Conservative spokeswoman said: "This poster campaign - which was offensive to many people - was a big misjudgement by Labour's campaign team."
