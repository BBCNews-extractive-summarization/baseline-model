Michael Howard has launched an attack on the cost of Britain's "chaotic" asylum system under Tony Blair. The Tory leader said English local authorities have spent more than £3bn - or £140 per household - on asylum since Labour won power in 1997. Mr Howard is expected to tell activists in Kent that voters' tolerance and desire to help others are being abused. Mr Howard said Britain should take its fair share of the world's "genuine refugees". Our asylum system is being abused - and with it Britain's generosity." Earlier this week, Mr Howard said his party's plans to cut immigration were not racist, arguing they would make the asylum system fairer for genuine refugees. Michael Howard's policy effectively means there is no safe haven in the UK. "When it comes to costs, then perhaps we should start with how decisions are made on asylum seekers. "We need good quality decision-making on asylum applications because it is delays in the system which cost so much." Tony Blair said Labour would set out workable plans for tackling immigration abuse in the next few weeks and attacked the Tory plans. On Monday, Mr Howard said: "It's not racist, as some people to claim, to talk about controlling immigration far from it."
