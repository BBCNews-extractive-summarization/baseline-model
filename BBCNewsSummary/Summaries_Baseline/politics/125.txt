Eurosceptic party UKIP have suspended a candidate for allegedly suggesting the criminally insane should be killed. John Houston, 54, was due to stand in the East Kilbride seat in Lanarkshire at the next election. But he was suspended after his reported views, including the return of the British Empire, were sent to two Scottish newspapers. UKIP spokesman Mark Croucher said those who selected Mr Houston knew nothing of his views. The episode comes at a difficult time for UKIP, soon after the high-profile departure of MEP Robert Kilroy-Silk. Mr Croucher said the main issue would be that Mr Houston's reported views had been presented as UKIP policy, which they were not. Mr Houston was quoted in the Herald newspaper saying: "I feel UKIP have over-reacted and overshot the runway." Peter Nielson, who is UKIP Scotland chairman, said he had suspended Mr Houston on Friday night.
