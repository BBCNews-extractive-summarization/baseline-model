Sir Anthony Meyer, the Tory backbencher who challenged Margaret Thatcher for the party leadership in 1989, has died. That failed "stalking horse" leadership challenge made it easier for Michael Heseltine to mount his own bid. Meyer's constituency party, Clwyd North West, which he had represented as an MP for more than 20 years, deselected him as a result of that challenge. Sir Anthony John Charles Meyer was born on 27 October, 1920. Labour regained the seat two years later, and Meyer had to wait until 1970 before he could re-enter Parliament.
