The Liberal Democrats are aiming to unseat a string of top Tories - including leader Michael Howard - at the next general election. Others targeted include Oliver Letwin, David Davis and Theresa May, Lib Dem's elections chief Lord Rennard said. He said it was "nothing personal" but that "very many of the prominent Conservatives" had slender leads in seats where the Lib Dems were second. But he urged Labour supporters to vote tactically to remove prominent Conservatives. "I just don't think Labour voters in these sort of seats could resist the temptation to use their votes effectively to remove a Conservative." The problem the Liberal Democrats face is that a large number of Lib Dem voters do not agree with their policies.
