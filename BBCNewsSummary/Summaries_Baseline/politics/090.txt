Climate change could be completely out of control within several decades, the Scottish Environment Protection Agency is warning a committee of MSPs. Experts are giving evidence on the subject to the Scottish Parliament's environment committee. Officials believe nuclear energy and wind farms may be better options than trying to tackle global warming. The evidence is part of the committee's inquiry into the impact of climate change in Scotland. Ecologists are warning MSPs that Scotland may have to accept "significant intrusion" from wind farms. Experts studying the seas off Scotland's west coast have already forecast more devastating weather of the type which caused havoc across the country last month.
