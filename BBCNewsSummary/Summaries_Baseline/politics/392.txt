The days of Britain having to apologise for its colonial past are over, Gordon Brown has said. The chancellor, speaking during a week-long tour of Africa, said it was time to talk about enduring British values of liberty and tolerance. Mr Brown has signed a debt relief deal with Tanzania which could cost the UK Â£1 billion. South African president Thabo Mbeki has attacked British imperialists, saying they treated Africans like savages. BBC political correspondent Mark Mardell said Britishness had long been a theme of the chancellor's but "never before has he been so outspoken in defending Britain's past history". The UK has pledged to pay 10% of the developing world's foreign debt bill in an attempt to fight poverty. The UK has already cancelled its bilateral debts - money the UK alone is owed - with the world's poorest nations including Tanzania.
