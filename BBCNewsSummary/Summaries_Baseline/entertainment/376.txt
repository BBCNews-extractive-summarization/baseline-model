French booksellers are braced for a rush of interest after another book from the author of The Da Vinci Code is translated into French. The Da Vinci Code is set in Paris - including the Louvre - and has sold around one million copies in France. The Da Vinci Code is being made into a film starring Tom Hanks. Angels and Demons is set mainly in Rome as symbologist Robert Langdon follows a 400-year-old trail to try to uncover a plot by an ancient brotherhood, The Illuminati, to blow up the Vatican. Such is the success of The Da Vinci Code in France, special tours have been organised to trace Langdon's footsteps, including the the Louvre museum and the Saint Sulpice Church. The film, to be directed by A Beautiful Mind's Ron Howard, is due to start filming at the Paris museum in May and stars Hanks alongside French actress Audrey Tautou.
