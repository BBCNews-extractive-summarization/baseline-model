Roxy Music will appear at June's Isle of Wight music festival, along with Morrissey, Supergrass and Idlewild. Original band members Bryan Ferry, Phil Manzerana, Andy Mackay and Paul Thompson will take to the stage on the Saturday night of the festival. Roxy Music were formed in 1971 by Ferry, Mackay and Brian Eno, with Manzanera joining the following year. Roxy Music's back catalogue was re-released in 2000, leading to the band undertaking a world tour in 2001.
