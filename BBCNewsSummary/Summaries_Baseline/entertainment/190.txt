Veteran comedian and broadcaster Cyril Fletcher has died aged 91 at his home in Guernsey. Fletcher will be remembered for his "odd odes" and amusing misprints on TV show That's Life in the 1970s and 80s, as well as a long variety career. He was also a regular on Does the Team Think?, a comic version of radio information show The Brains Trust. "The thing about Cyril was that he was, to use a slightly old-fashioned phrase, an English gentleman," she said. One of the last comedians of old-time variety era, Fletcher made his first TV appearance in 1937. A year after BBC Television began, he was seen reciting humorous poems, appearing in a revue, Tele-Ho, and playing the Emperor of Morocco in the first televised pantomime, Dick Whittington. In the mid-1990s, Fletcher said he had made a "fabulous living" since the age of 22 and had never had a day out of work. Fletcher was described as a "consummate professional" by his friend and fellow broadcaster Michael Pointon. Fletcher's daughter Jill said her father would be sorely missed.
