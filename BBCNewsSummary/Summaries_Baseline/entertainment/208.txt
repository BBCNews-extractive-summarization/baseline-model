Chart stars Duran Duran are to appear in a VH1 special in the US including interviews and concert footage. The show airs on Tuesday and will feature a studio performance, behind the scenes footage and fan interviews. "They seemed like a perfect fit with our audience," said Rick Krim, VH1's vice president of music and talent. The band recently released a new album, Astronaut, the first from the original line-up since 1983. We just really wanted to make a great Duran Duran album," said keyboard player Nick Rhodes. Duran Duran are currently promoting the album's second single, What Happens Tomorrow. Simon Le Bon said earlier this year that the group were not trying to update their sound too much.
