The original stars of Swedish pop quartet Abba have reunited for the home premiere of hit musical Mamma Mia! It is the first time in almost 20 years that the four, Bjorn Ulvaeus, Benny Andersson, Agnetha Faltskog and Anni-Frid Lyngstad, have met publicly. The musical, which has become a global phenomenon, will be performed in Swedish for the first time. The premiere marks Abba's first public reunion since the legendary band's acrimonious break-up in the early 1980s. Original Abba member Bjorn Ulvaeus set about translating the musical into the band's mother tongue for the celebrated homecoming, alongside Swedish artist Niklas Stromstedt. The show will include such classics as Super Trouper, SOS and Dancing Queen.
