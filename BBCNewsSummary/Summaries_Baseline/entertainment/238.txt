Cult British group Portishead have revealed they are writing their third album, their first in eight years. Founding member Geoff Barrow told BBC 6 Music the record was well on the way to being completed. Portishead will play alongside fellow Bristol band Massive Attack at Oxfam's Tsumani appeal, held at the Bristol Academy on 19 February. Portishead will not play any new material at next month's concert, which will feature singer Beth Gibbons playing with an acoustic backing. Portishead became an international success and a deeply influential band despite their scant recorded output. The follow up, Portishead, was released three years later.
