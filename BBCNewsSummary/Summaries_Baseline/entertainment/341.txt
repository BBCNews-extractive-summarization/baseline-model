Actor Daniel Day-Lewis is to be presented with an award for his career in film at the Berlin Film Festival. The honour, awarded since 1986, honours figures in cinema that the festival feels "particularly indebted to". Man to Man, a historical epic starring Kristin Scott Thomas, opens the German festival on 10 February. Day-Lewis has competed four times at the Berlin Film Festival, with films In The Name Of The Father (1994), The Crucible (1997), The Boxer (1998) and Martin Scorsese's Gangs Of New York (2003). Japan's oldest film studio will also be honoured along with Day-Lewis.
