A US television network will screen a celebrity TV special to benefit the tsunami relief effort in South Asia. Around 140,000 people were killed and five million left homeless or without food and water after an earthquake below the Indian Ocean sent waves crashing into coastal communities in 11 countries. Performers have yet to be confirmed for NBC's aid relief benefit later this month. It follows a two-hour telethon carried by all four major US television networks 10 days after the 11 September terror attacks in 2001. America: A Tribute to Heroes raised more than $150m (Â£79m) to help victims of the suicide attacks on the World Trade Center and Pentagon.
