Young book fans have voted Fergus Crane, a story about a boy who is taken on an adventure by a flying horse, the winner of two Smarties Book Prizes. Biscuit Bear by Mini Grey took the top award in the under-five category. The prize, which is celebrating its 20th year, is billed as "the UK's biggest children's book award". As well as the six to eights prize, it won the 4Children Special Award voted for by after-school club members. "This award counts because the final choice of winners is made by children, who are the toughest critics of all," she said.
