Actor Michael Douglas is to co-produce and star in an adventure film about a diamond robbery set in India. Another Hollywood star is being lined up to co-star, while the rest of the cast will be Indian. Douglas added that it had been inspired by a Wall Street Journal article about India's 'angadias', who courier money and diamonds around India. Shailendra Singh, the founder of India's Percept Films, said there would be "a lot of India" in the movie - and that an Indian train would play a big role. Swashbuckling adventure film Romancing The Stone saw Douglas's female co-star Kathleen Turner win a Golden Globe award for her performance in 1985.
