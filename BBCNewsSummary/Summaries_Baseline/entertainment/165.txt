Comedian Chris Morris, who created controversial TV show Brass Eye, is to return to screens with a new sitcom about a spoof London media worker. Morris will direct and co-write Nathan Barley - a character from cult website TV Go Home - for Channel 4. Nathan Barley will be "a character-driven comedy", according to Charlie Brooker, who created TV Go Home in 1999 and has co-written the series. As well as Brass Eye, Morris was behind another news show satire, The Day Today, and dark sketch comedy Jam.
