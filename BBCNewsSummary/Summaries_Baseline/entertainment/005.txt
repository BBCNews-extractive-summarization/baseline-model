The stage adaptation of children's film Mary Poppins has had its opening night in London's West End. Technical hitches had prevented Mary Poppins' flight into the auditorium during preview performances. Mary Poppins was originally created by author Pamela Travers, who is said to have cried when she saw Disney's 1964 film starring Julie Andrews. Theatre impresario Sir Cameron Mackintosh has said he hopes the musical is a blend of the sweet-natured film and the original book.
