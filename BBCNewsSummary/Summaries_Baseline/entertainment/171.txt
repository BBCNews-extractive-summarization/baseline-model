US politicians are proposing a tough new law aimed at cracking down on indecency and bad language on US TV. Fines of up to $500,000 (Â£266,582) could be imposed each time broadcasters transmit nudity or profanities. Republican politician Fred Upton, who chairs the committee responsible for broadcasting, said current fines are "more of a cost of doing business rather than a deterrent". Last year's Janet Jackson 'wardrobe malfunction' encouraged the FCC to impose tougher rules, but the US Congress adjourned last year without agreeing on a new level of fines. Certain broadcasters, like Fox, claim the material they carry does not violate indecency laws and is protected under the right to free speech.
