US musical Sweet Charity has cancelled its run on Broadway after poor ticket sales for its early shows. Producer Barry Weissler said he was "deeply proud" of the show, but said the decision to close it was "painful but fiscally responsible". Previews of the $7.5m (Â£4m) show were due to begin on 4 April. Sweet Charity tells the story of Charity Hope Valentine, a dancer who always falls in love with the wrong man.
