Merle Kilgore, co-writer of the country hit Ring of Fire, has died of congestive heart failure aged 70. He wrote Ring of Fire with June Carter Cash, the future wife of Johnny Cash who went on to score his most popular hit with the track. His death has been attributed to treatment he was undergoing for the cancer. His first self-penned top 10 hit was Dear Mama in 1959. He then wrote Ring of Fire with June Carter Cash, which was about her unrequited love for Johnny, who she later married.
