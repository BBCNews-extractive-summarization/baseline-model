Hollywood star Tom Hanks was in London's Leicester Square for the UK premiere of Polar Express. "This is Leicester Square like you've never seen it before," said Hanks, who plays five roles in the movie. Hanks said that the new film has an "elegant message". The "performance capture" technique enables Hanks to play a number of roles, including the eight-year-old boy who is at the centre of the story, and Father Christmas. It is directed by Robert Zemeckis, who has previously worked with Hanks on Forrest Gump and Castaway.
