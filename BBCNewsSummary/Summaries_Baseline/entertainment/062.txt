The best first screenplay award went to Joshua Marston for Maria Full of Grace. Actor Rodrigo de la Serna took the best debut performance prize for The Motorcycle Diaries. Last year's big winner, Lost In Translation, went on to win the Oscar for best original screenplay, for writer-director Sofia Coppola.
