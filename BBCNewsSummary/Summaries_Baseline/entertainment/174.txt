TV talent show The X Factor is to return for a second series after being recommissioned by ITV. Judges Simon Cowell, Louis Walsh and Sharon Osbourne are in discussions to sign up for the new series. Last Saturday's show was beaten in the ratings by the BBC's Strictly Come Dancing. I predict series two will be even better," said Cowell. The Pop Idol-style show votes off a group or contestant every week - the two that receive the lowest public vote have to perform a second time before the judges make a final decision.
