A film that follows a group of alienated youth in a Paris suburb as they prepare to perform an 18th Century play has won France's top cinema award. L'Esquive earned a Cesar prize for its director, Tunisian-born Abdellatif Kechiche, and its young star, the 18-year-old actress Sara Forestier. US film Lost in Translation won the award for best foreign feature. Its late release in France made it a contender for this year's Cesars. A Very Long Engagement, a World War I drama featuring Audrey Tautou, won five Cesar awards.
