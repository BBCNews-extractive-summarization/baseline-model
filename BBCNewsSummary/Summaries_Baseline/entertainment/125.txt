Snow Patrol were the big winners in Ireland's top music honours, the Meteor Awards, picking up accolades for best Irish band and album on Thursday. Westlife won the award for best Irish pop act, voted for by the public, beating former member Brian McFadden. Franz Ferdinand picked up best international band and album while Paddy Casey collected best Irish male. Snow Patrol's success came after a year in which they made a chart breakthrough with their third album Final Straw. Snow Patrol will support U2 on their European tour later this year - but U2 were not nominated for best Irish band and album.
