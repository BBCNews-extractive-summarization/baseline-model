Oscar-winning animator Hayao Miyazaki's latest film, Howl's Moving Castle, is to be released in 50 countries around the world, its distributor has said. Howl's Moving Castle set a Japanese box office record last week, taking 1.5bn yen (£7.7m) in its first two days. Miyazaki won an Oscar earlier this year for Spirited Away, Japan's first Academy Award for nearly 50 years. A spokesman for distributor Toho said the film "has received strong interest from domestic audiences and foreign media and viewers alike". The film's worldwide release will start in South Korea on 24 December, and France on 12 January.
