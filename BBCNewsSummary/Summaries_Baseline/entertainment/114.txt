Singer Pete Doherty will have to spend the weekend in jail because he could not come up with Â£150,000 bond money for his bail on time. The former Libertines singer had been granted bail with curfew restrictions at Highbury Corner Magistrates Court on charges of robbery and blackmail. Mr Doherty, 25, was arrested following an alleged incident in a London hotel on Wednesday evening. Magistrates imposed a range of bail conditions on Mr Doherty including a curfew between 2200 and 0700, except when he attends a drug rehabilitation centre. Mr Doherty left The Libertines at the end of June 2004, but continued performing with his band Babyshambles. A lawyer representing Mr Doherty and Mr Wass said outside court the pair strenuously denied the charges.
