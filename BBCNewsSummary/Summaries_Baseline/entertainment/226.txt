The head of US TV network Fox has admitted the broadcaster had relied too heavily on reality TV shows such as the poor-rating Who's Your Daddy. Last season, Fox's prime-time audience fell by 600,000 to 5.9 million. Ms Berman said: "I think the audience expects loud things from Fox. Five other episodes of the show had also been filmed will be dropped from Fox's schedules, Ms Berman said. Fox had unveiled a new strategy last year promising to launch new shows every season, including the traditionally quiet summer season. Fox has changed this plan, launching new shows in May instead of June.
