The BBC has said there are no plans in the pipeline for a new series of hit comedy Blackadder, which ended in 1989. Tony Robinson, who played the servant Baldrick, told ITV1's This Morning the show's star, Rowan Atkinson, was "more keen than he has been in the past". But the BBC said on Thursday there were no plans for a comeback. Blackadder returned for a one-off special filmed to celebrate the arrival of the millennium in 1999.
