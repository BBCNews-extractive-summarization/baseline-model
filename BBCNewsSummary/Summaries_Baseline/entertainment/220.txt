Other nominees include The Guardian news website, the National Theatre, MTV, the Science Museum and the London Stock Exchange. The BBC has 16 nominations while The Guardian has three nominations. ITV's Great British Spelling Test takes on the BBC's Olympics and Spooks Interactive for the interactive TV award. The BBC's iCan site is up for the technical and social innovation award alongside the likes of Nottingham University's Uncle Roy All Around You. In 2002, the British Academy of Film and Television decided to split the awards into separate games and interactive ceremonies, to fully cover the range of innovation outside the gaming industry.
