Brits success has helped return Keane's award-winning album Hopes and Fears back to the top of the UK album chart. The debut album, which took the best British album title at the Brits on Tuesday, moved up seven places from number eight to number one. Also capitalising on Brits success were the Scissor Sisters whose eponymous album moved three places to number two. There was more follow up to Brits success for Franz Ferdinand won best rock act and best British group last week. Last week's number one album Tourist, by Athlete, fell to number three.
