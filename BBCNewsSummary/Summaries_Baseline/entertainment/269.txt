Singer George Michael has said that a new film about his life is the start of a retirement from public view. "I thought I should explain myself before I disappear," said Michael, who was at the Berlin film festival to launch the documentary. The film, A Different Story, chronicles Michael's life and career from the 1980s and his personal struggles. The 41-year-old chart-topper told reporters in the German capital that he wanted to "move his career into a different form", but added that he does not know what it is going to be yet. Michael said that the film, directed by Southan Morris, would put his two decades of fame into context. The film also deals with the loss of Michael's partner Anselmo Feleppa from an Aids-related condition in 1993.
