Rock singer Pete Doherty has been involved in a fight with his band's guitarist at their biggest gig to date. Babyshambles played for 5,000 fans at London's Brixton Academy on Tuesday. The former Libertines singer traded blows with guitarist Patrick Walden. On Monday Doherty faced blackmail and robbery charges in court, which he denies. Babyshambles, which he formed after his acrimonious departure from the Libertines, played a warm-up show at The Garage, north London, on Monday. On Tuesday, Doherty and his three bandmates were introduced to the crowd by Mick Jones, the former Clash guitarist who produced the Libertines' second album. Doherty appealed to fans to calm down, saying: "There's a few people getting hurt down the front, you've got to move back." Doherty, 25, had to be home by midnight to observe the curfew, which is one of the conditions of his bail.
