Pop Idol supremo Simon Fuller has sold his 19 Entertainment company to an US entrepreneur in a $156m (£81.5m) deal. Mr Fuller has been appointed to the CFX board and will plan and implement the company's creative strategy. The deal sees Mr Fuller receive £64.5m in cash and about 1.9 million shares in Sports Entertainment. Mr Fuller has signed a long-term agreement with the company which will see him continue to expand and develop entertainment brands. Mr Fuller was the creative drive behind Pop Idol and its US offspring American Idol. The company was set up 15 years ago by Mr Fuller, taking the name from his first successful single - 19 by Paul Hardcastle. Fuller was the driving force behind the Spice Girls phenomenon, using canny marketing and catchy pop songs to secure their place as the most lucrative girl group in history.
