French actress Audrey Tautou, star of hit film Amelie, will play the female lead in the film adaptation of The Da Vinci Code, it has been reported. The movie version of Dan Brown's best-selling novel is being directed by Ron Howard and also stars Tom Hanks. Tautou will play Hanks' code-cracking partner, according to various newspapers. Jeunet was also responsible for directing Tautou in Amelie in 2001, which launched the actress into the mainstream. Oscar-winning director Ron Howard chose Tautou for the part, preferring a French actress to a big name Hollywood star.
