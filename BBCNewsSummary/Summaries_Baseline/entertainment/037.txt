Plans to portray Dominica's Carib Indians as cannibals in the sequel to hit film Pirates of the Caribbean have been criticised by the group's chief. Carib Chief Charles Williams said talks with Disney's producers revealed there was "a strong element of cannibalism in the script which cannot be removed". The Caribbean island's government said Disney planned to film in Dominica. The Caribs have long denied their ancestors practised cannibalism. Shooting on the sequel is expected to begin in April, with hundreds of Dominicans applying to be extras in the movie. Mr Williams said he had received support from indigenous groups around the world in his efforts to have cannibalism references removed from the film. The first Pirates of the Caribbean film took $305m (Â£162m) at the box office in the US alone.
