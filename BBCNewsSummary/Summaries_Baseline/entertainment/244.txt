Richey Edwards, guitarist and lyricist for The Manic Street Preachers, vanished 10 years ago, on 1 February 1995. His disappearance remains one of the most tragic mysteries in rock music. For his devoted fans, Richey Edwards was an inspired and inspiring poet, a man who articulated their desperation and despair, who shouted the things most kept hidden. The Manic Street Preachers may only have become stadium-conquering rock giants since his disappearance - but Edwards was the figurehead for their first, dangerous and dazzling incarnation. But Edwards replaced Flicker in time for the band's self-financed debut, Suicide Alley, after designing the record's artwork. But the fiercely intelligent Edwards - who name-checked writers such as Sylvia Plath, George Orwell and Philip Larkin - battled depression, alcohol problems, eating disorders, and self-harm. By the time the band released their third album, The Holy Bible, in October 1994, Edwards had been admitted to hospital with depression. Police discover Edwards' car in a car park near the Severn Bridge near Bristol - a notorious suicide spot. The discovery leads many to believe he has killed himself. The band play their first concerts since Edwards' disappearance as a trio, performing support slots for The Stone Roses on their UK stadium tour. The Manic Street Preachers release their first music since Edwards' disappearance. The Manics win best band and best album for Everything Must Go at the Brit Awards. Edwards' sister Rachel makes an emotional TV appeal five years after the disappearance. On the seventh anniversary of his disappearance, police offer Edwards' parents the opportunity to sign a death certificate. The Manics' seventh studio album, Lifeblood, features a song dedicated to Edwards called Cardiff Afterlife.
