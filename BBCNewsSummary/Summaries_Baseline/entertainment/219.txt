Veteran US television host Dick Clark is in hospital in Los Angeles after suffering a mild stroke. Clark is scheduled to welcome in the New Year on the ABC network, a job he has done for 33 years. Clark's publicist Paul Shefrin said the television host was "recovering" and there was no cause for alarm. Clark, who produces the Golden Globe and American Music Awards, disclosed last year that he was suffering from diabetes. Clark was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1993 for his contribution to the music industry.
