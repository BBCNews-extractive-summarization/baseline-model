Reporters covering singer Michael Jackson's trial in California have asked to see questionnaires completed by potential jurors. Lawyers for news organisations said it was "really vital" for the responses of 250 potential jurors to be made public "to serve as a check on the process". Mr Jackson denies child molestation. Defence lawyers argued against the bid by Associated Press and other news organisations to have potential jurors' responses made public. "The release of the completed jury questionnaires does not serve any purpose other than to add to the sensationalist coverage of this case," a motion by Mr Jackson's lawyers stated. Mr Jackson, 46, denies plying a boy with alcohol and molesting him. His mother Katherine Jackson told US TV network Fox News on Sunday that her pop star son told her he was innocent. Describing Mr Jackson as "a good person", the mother-of-nine said she feared he would not be given a fair trial.
