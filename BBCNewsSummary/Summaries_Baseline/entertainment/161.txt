Premiership footballer and record company boss Kevin Campbell has gained a court injunction stopping R&B singer Mark Morrison from releasing an album. The Everton striker signed Morrison to his fledging 2 Wikid Records label and claims he spent thousands of pounds producing his album Innocent Man. Now he is attempting to prevent Morrison releasing the album on Monday through another label. But Morrison vowed to ignore the order, saying "no judge is gonna stop me". Morrison, who is now as well known for his brushes with the law than his music career, rose to fame with the 1996 single Return of the Mack. But Mr Campbell said he learned that Morrison planned to release the album through Jet Star, which is advertising it on its website. "Mark Morrison was given everything he asked for by 2 Wikid but it seems that he couldn't help but return to his old ways. "I have always dreamt of starting a record label but now Mark Morrison has spoilt that dream for me. But Morrison is determined the album will be released on Monday.
