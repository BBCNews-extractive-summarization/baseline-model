Irish rock band U2 are to play live at the Grammy Awards presentation in the US next month, organisers have said. U2 are nominated twice for their recent single Vertigo, including a nomination for best rock song. Last week Grammy producers announced the show will be hosted by rap star and Chicago actress Queen Latifah. U2 had number one success in the album charts on both sides of the Atlantic in November when their latest studio album, How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb, topped the US and UK charts.
