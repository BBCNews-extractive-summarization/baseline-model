Fans who buy tickets for this year's Glastonbury festival will be issued with photo ID cards in an attempt to beat touts, it has been confirmed. The cards will include a photograph of the ticket-holder plus an electronic chip with their details to prevent tickets being sold on or forged. Fans not wanting to carry the entrance card could present their passport or driving licence instead, he added. When the ID card idea was floated, Mr Eavis' daughter Emily said it would be "quite a big step in terms of ticketing for events" if implemented and they were "going as far as we can" to cut touting. They were personalised with the names of purchasers, who were asked to bring identification, such as a driving licence, passport or household bill. No details of this year's line-up have been confirmed but rumours have suggested U2 and Coldplay may be among the headliners.
