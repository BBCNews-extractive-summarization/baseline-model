Jennifer Lopez cancelled an appearance at the UK charity premiere of her new movie saying she was too ill to fly. The actress and singer dropped out at the last minute and has now cancelled all European promotion of the film Shall We Dance? Co-star Richard Gere attended the event held in aid of the tsunami appeal. The film's director Peter Chelsom said he was disappointed that Lopez did not attend. I know it's true that she's not well because she has also cancelled her promotional tour. Other stars who turned out on the night included Honor Blackman, Strictly Come Dancing presenter Tess Daly and actress Anita Dobson. Lopez issues a statement apologising for her absence. Lopez appeared at the Grammy awards on Sunday, singing a duet with her third husband Marc Anthony.
