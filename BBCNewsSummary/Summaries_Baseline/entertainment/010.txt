Uganda's authorities have banned the play The Vagina Monologues, due to open in the capital, Kampala this weekend. The Ugandan Media Council said the performance would not be put on as it promoted and glorified acts such as lesbianism and homosexuality. The show, which has been a controversial sell-out around the world, explores female sexuality and strength through individual women telling their stories through monologues. "There is obviously some fear of the vagina and saying the word vagina," Ms Ensler told the BBC. She said the play is being produced and performed by Ugandan women and it is not being forced on them. "I'm extremely outraged at the hypocrisy," the play's organiser in Uganda, Sarah Mukasa, told the BBC's Focus on Africa programme. "I'm amazed that this country Uganda gives the impression that it is progressive and supports women's rights and the notions of free speech; yet when women want to share their stories the government uses the apparatus of state to shut us up."
