Actor Robert Blake had gunshot residue on his hands and clothes the night his wife was shot dead, a court has heard. Mr Dowell told a Los Angeles court the residue may have come from Mr Blake's revolver, his gun collection, his presence at the crime scene or police. The 71-year-old former star of US TV drama Baretta has denied murder. But Mr Dowell also said the residue would have been present if Mr Blake fired a gun that night. The actor, who won an Emmy for playing a maverick detective in the 1970s TV cop drama Baretta, could face life in prison if convicted.
