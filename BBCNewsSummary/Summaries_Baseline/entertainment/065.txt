Oscar-winning director Hayao Miyazaki's latest film has set a new Japanese box office record, with 1.5bn yen ($14.3m) in two days, according to reports. Howl's Moving Castle is the follow-up to Miyazaki's Spirited Away, which won best animation at last year's Oscars. It has registered the highest opening weekend takings of any Japanese film in the country, according to trade publication Screen Daily. The film's distributor Toho expects 40 million people to see it in total - almost one third of the country's population - it added.
