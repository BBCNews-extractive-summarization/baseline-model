Hollywood blockbuster The Aviator and low-budget British movie Vera Drake have shared the main honours at the 2005 Bafta film awards. The Aviator was declared best film, and its star Cate Blanchett won best supporting actress. But Vera Drake scored best director for Mike Leigh while Imelda Staunton took the hotly contested best actress award. But big British hope Kate Winslet walked away empty-handed on Saturday despite two nominations for best actress. Blanchett, who won a Bafta in 1999 for her leading role in Elizabeth, said: "Winning a Bafta means an enormous amount to me." The Aviator took four awards in all, also collecting best make-up and hair and production design, while Vera Drake also scooped best costume design. Staunton, who is up for an Oscar for her role in Vera Drake, arrived wearing a green silk and chiffon beaded evening dress. "I'm honoured and proud to receive this Bafta. DiCaprio, who lost out on the best actor Bafta to Foxx, will face him again at the Academy Awards in two weeks' time. "It's the first time I've come to the Baftas because it's the first time I've been nominated," he told reporters on the red carpet. Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban won the Orange Film Of The Year, voted for by the public. The Orange British Academy Film Awards are being shown on BBC One from 2010 GMT.
