To mark the 60th anniversary of the birth of reggae star Bob Marley, Rob Partridge - Marley's former head of press at Island Records - remembers the man behind the legend. Partridge worked with Marley from 1977 until the Jamaican musician's death in 1981.

: "I joined Island Records in 1977 and the first week I was there I worked on his show at the Rainbow Theatre. It was one of the last dates he did in London." I remember going to see dates in Milan and Turin and they were enormous concerts." : Bob was one of the most mesmeric people I've ever had the privilege to work with. Bob was a very driven individual. He didn't suffer fools gladly. At the risk of stating the obvious, he was an extraordinary song writer and his stage act was perhaps the greatest I've ever seen. I saw him many times." "The last time I saw him was in London in 1980. "Bob was a good player. Reggae did not correspond with disco in the 70s. "We saw Black America taking Bob into their hearts for the first time." If you went to Africa he would be recognised everywhere, in places John Lennon or Elvis wouldn't be. : Well 1981 was to be the year he toured Africa with Stevie Wonder. He had only performed in Zimbabwe and Guinea before. : "Bob was endlessly optimistic about the way Africa would turn out. : "The final tune of his final album was Redemption Song - one of the most incredible classics of all time."
