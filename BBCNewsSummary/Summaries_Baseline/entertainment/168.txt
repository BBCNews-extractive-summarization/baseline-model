MTV has been criticised for "incessant sleaze" by television indecency campaigners in the US. But a spokeswoman for MTV said it was "unfair and inaccurate" to single out MTV for criticism. In its report - MTV Smut Peddlers: Targeting Kids with Sex, Drugs and Alcohol - the PTC said it witnessed 3,056 flashes of nudity or sexual situations and 2,881 verbal references to sex. Brent Bozell, PTC president and conservative activist said: "MTV is blatantly selling raunchy sex to kids. The watchdog decided to look at MTV's programmes after Janet Jackson's infamous "wardrobe malfunction" at last year's Super Bowl. The breast-baring incident generated 500,000 complaints and CBS - which is owned by the same parent company as MTV - was quick to apologise. "It's unfair and inaccurate to paint MTV with that brush of irresponsibility," she said.
