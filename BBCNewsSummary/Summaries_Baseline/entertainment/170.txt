Plans to create a US soap based on the BBC's EastEnders have reportedly been drawn up by the Fox TV network. EastEnders' head writer Tony Jordan and music mogul Simon Fuller are involved in the project, according to reports in the Hollywood Reporter trade newspaper. The original EastEnders was pulled from BBC America last year after it proved a failure in the ratings. At home, EastEnders has been facing its own ratings battle, recently losing out to rival ITV soap Emmer dale.
