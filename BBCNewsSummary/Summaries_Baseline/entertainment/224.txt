Actor Colin Farrell is to make his debut on US television in medical sitcom Scrubs, according to Hollywood newspaper Daily Variety. The film star, who recently played the title role in historical blockbuster Alexander, will make a cameo appearance as an unruly Irishman. Farrell's appearance is said to be a result of his friendship with Zach Braff, who stars in the programme. It will be the actor's first appearance on the small screen since he appeared in BBC series Ballykissangel in 1999. Farrell is pencilled in to play the role of Crockett in a film version of 1980s police drama Miami Vice.
