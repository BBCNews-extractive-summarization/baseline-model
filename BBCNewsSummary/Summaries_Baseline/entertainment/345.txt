Pop star Britney Spears has attacked "false" and "desperate" US tabloid magazines, questioning their honesty after they reported she was pregnant. Stories about the state of her marriage to Kevin Federline and rumours about a pregnancy have recently appeared. In February, Spears clashed with Us Weekly for publishing pictures of her honeymoon in Fiji without permission. Us magazine was unrepentant about their decision to publish, saying: "Britney should start her own magazine if she'd like to dictate her own coverage." Spears claimed that other magazines were approached with the pictures but chose to contact her instead.
