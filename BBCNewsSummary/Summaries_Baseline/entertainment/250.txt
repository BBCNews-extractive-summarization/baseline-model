Prince earned more than any other pop star in 2004, beating artists such Madonna and Elton John in US magazine Rolling Stone's annual list. The singer banked $56.5m (£30.4m) from concerts, album and publishing sales with his Musicology tour and album. He kept Madonna in second place, as she earned $54.9m (£29.5m) while embarking on her global Re-Invention Tour. "Prince returned to centre stage after a decade in the commercial wilderness," the magazine reported. Although she grossed more than Prince last year, Madonna remained in second place because of the "monumental" production costs of her tour.
