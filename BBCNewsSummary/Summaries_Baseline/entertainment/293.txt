Former Stone Roses singer Ian Brown was arrested after a fight during a concert in San Francisco on Tuesday, his spokesman has said. A fan jumped on stage and attacked the singer, who then became involved in a fracas with a security guard, Fiction Records spokesman Paul Smernicki said. He said Brown was arrested at his hotel after the show at the Great American Music Hall but released without charge. Brown then got into a brawl with another man who tried to restrain him - without realising he was a security guard, Mr Smernicki added. Police took witness statements and apprehended Brown at his hotel, Mr Smernicki said. Brown, 42, was lead singer with The Stone Roses, one of the most seminal bands in British rock, until they split in 1996.
