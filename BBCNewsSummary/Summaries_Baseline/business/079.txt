Almost a quarter of a million US consumers complained of being targeted for identity theft in 2004, official figures suggest. The Federal Trade Commission said two in five of the 635,173 reports it had from consumers concerned ID fraud. ID theft occurs when criminals use someone else's personal information to steal credit or commit other crimes. The biggest slice of the 246,570 ID fraud cases reported - almost 30% - concerned abuses of people's credit. Outside the field of ID theft, 53% of the near-400,000 complaints were internet-related.
