Japanese industrial output fell in October while unemployment rose, casting further doubt on the strength of the country's economic recovery. Japan's government remains optimistic due to strong domestic demand. Analysts had been forecasting a 0.1% rise in month on month industrial output. According to figures from the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI), the decline was led by a fall in demand for electronic parts for mobile phones and digital televisions. Japan downgraded its overall economic assessment earlier this month for the first time in a year. Japanese government officials played down the latest data, arguing that domestic consumer demand was still resilient. The comparatively weak economic date preyed on shares with the Nikkei down 1% in afternoon trade.
