Channel Tunnel operator Eurotunnel has seen sales fall in the face of the upsurge in European low-cost airlines. Income from its vehicle-carrying shuttle services fell 7%, although 15% more passengers meant a 2% rise in railway revenue. The cross-Channel truck market is improving, Eurotunnel said, but warned that it was not benefiting since much of the traffic was in containers destined for ports. The passenger-only trains which use the tunnel are run by a separate company, Eurostar. Eurotunnel is still struggling with debts of more than 6bn euros.
