A close associate of former Yukos boss Mikhail Khodorkovsky has told a court that fraud charges levelled against him are "false". The pair claim they are being punished by the authorities for the political ambitions of Mr Khodorkovsky. Mr Lebedev and Mr Khodorkovsky, who each face a possible 10 year jail sentence if convicted, will be questioned by a judge over the next few days. Mr Khodorkovsky began his testimony last week, telling the court that he objected to the way that the "running of a normal business has been presented as a work of criminal fiction". The charges are seen by supporters as politically motivated and part of a drive by Russian President Vladimir Putin to rein in the country's super-rich business leaders, the so-called oligarchs.
