Luxury goods group LVMH has sold its loss-making Christian Lacroix clothing label to a US investment group. The sale of the Lacroix label comes as many fashion houses are struggling to make money from their expensive haute couture ranges. Mr Lacroix said he planned to stay at the label he founded in 1987 although exact details are still to be confirmed.
