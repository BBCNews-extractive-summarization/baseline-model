India's biggest carmaker Maruti has reported a sharp increase in quarterly profit after a booming economy and low interest rates boosted demand. Maruti accounts for half of India's domestic car sales, luring consumers with cheap, fuel-efficient vehicles. Demand in India also has been driven by the poor state of public transport and the very low level of car ownership, analysts said. Maruti beat market expectations despite an increase in raw materials costs. Maruti is not the only company benefiting as Indian's economic growth gives consumer greater spending power.
