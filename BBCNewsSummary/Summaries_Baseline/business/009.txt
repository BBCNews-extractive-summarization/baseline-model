Ethiopia produced 14.27 million tonnes of crops in 2004, 24% higher than in 2003 and 21% more than the average of the past five years, a report says. In 2003, crop production totalled 11.49 million tonnes, the joint report from the Food and Agriculture Organisation and the World Food Programme said. Nevertheless, 2.2 million Ethiopians will still need emergency assistance. In eastern and southern Ethiopia, a prolonged drought has killed crops and drained wells. Agriculture is the main economic activity in Ethiopia, representing 45% of gross domestic product.
