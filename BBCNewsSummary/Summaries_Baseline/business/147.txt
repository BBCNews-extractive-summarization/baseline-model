Malaysia's central bank is to relax restrictions on foreign ownership to encourage Islamic banking. Banks in Malaysia will now be able to sell up to 49% of their Islamic banking units, while the limit on other kinds of bank remains at 30%. RHB, Malaysia's third-biggest lender, is already scouting for a foreign partner for its new Islamic banking unit, the firm told Reuters. Malaysia changed the law to allow Islamic banking in 1983. Islamic banks offer services which permit modern banking principles while sticking to Islamic law's ban on the payment of interest.
