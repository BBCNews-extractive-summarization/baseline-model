German business confidence fell in February knocking hopes of a speedy recovery in Europe's largest economy. Munich-based research institute Ifo said that its confidence index fell to 95.5 in February from 97.5 in January, its first decline in three months. "We're surprised that the Ifo index has taken such a knock," said DZ bank economist Bernd Weidensteiner. Economy and Labour Minister Wolfgang Clement called the dip in February's Ifo confidence figure "a very mild decline". Germany's economy grew 1.6% last year after shrinking in 2003. Latest indications are that growth is still proving elusive and Ifo president Hans-Werner Sinn said any improvement in German domestic demand was sluggish. Analysts said that the Ifo figures and Germany's continuing problems may delay an interest rate rise by the European Central Bank.
