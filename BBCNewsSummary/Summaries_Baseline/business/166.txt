The Â£10bn Crossrail transport plan, backed by business groups, is to get the go-ahead this month, according to The Mail on Sunday. The much delayed Crossrail Link Bill would provide for a fast cross-London rail link. "We've always said we are going to introduce a hybrid Bill for Crossrail in the Spring and this remains the case," the Department for Transport said on Sunday. The new line would go out as far as Maidenhead, Berkshire, to the west of London, and link Heathrow to Canary Wharf via the City. Heathrow to the City would take 40 minutes, dramatically cutting journey times for business travellers, and reducing overcrowding on the tube.
