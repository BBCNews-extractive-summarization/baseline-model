UK condom maker SSL International has refused to comment on reports it may be subject to a takeover early in 2005. An spokesman for SSL, which makes the famous Durex brand of condom, would not to comment on "market speculation". The FT said most the high-profile firm that might woo SSL was Anglo-Dutch household products group Reckitt Benckiser. Eighteen months ago Reckitt Benckiser was at the centre of a rumoured takeover bid for SSL - but that came to nothing. Analysts have seen SSL as a takeover target for years.
