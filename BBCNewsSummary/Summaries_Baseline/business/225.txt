The January sales have failed to help the UK High Street recover from a poor Christmas season, a survey has found. Stores received a boost from bargain hunters but trading then reverted to December levels, the British Retail Consortium and accountants KPMG said. Sales in what is traditionally a strong month rose by 0.5% on a like-for-like basis, compared with a year earlier. But clothing and footwear sales were said to be generally better than December, while department stores also had a good month. And according to Office for National Statistics data, sales in December failed to meet expectations and by some counts were the worst since 1981.
