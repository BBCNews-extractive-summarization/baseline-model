German football club and former European champion Borussia Dortmund has warned it will go bankrupt if rescue talks with creditors fail. Borussia Dortmund has posted record losses and missed rent payments on its Westfallen stadium. Shares in Borussia Dortmund, Germany's only stock-market listed football club, dropped by almost 23% to 2.05 euros during early afternoon trading. Fund manager Florian Hamm - Borussia Dortmund's largest investor - said he would only invest more money in the company if he got a greater say in how it is run. Borussia Dortmund posted a record loss of 68m euros ($89m; Â£47m) in the 12 months through June. Stephen Schechter, a UK investment banker who has held talks with Borussia Dortmund over a possible bond sale, said the club needs a capital injection of 35m euros.
