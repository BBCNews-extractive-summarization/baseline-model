Germany's unemployment figure rose above the psychologically important level of five million last month. On Wednesday, the German Federal Labour Agency said the jobless total had reached 5.037 million in January, which takes the jobless rate to 12.1%. "Yes, we have effectively more than five million people unemployed," a government minister said earlier on ZDF public television. Unemployment has not been this high in Germany since the 1930s. It said there are a further 1.5 million-2 million people on subsidised employment schemes who are, in fact, looking for real jobs. Adjusted for the seasonal factors, the German jobless total rose by 227,000 in January from December.
