US behemoth General Electric has posted an 18% jump in quarterly sales, and in profits, and declared itself "in great shape". "We are benefiting from our growth initiatives and an excellent global economy," said GE's chief executive Jeff Immelt. GE is the US' biggest firm based on stock market valuation. "The industries GE is in are doing very well. The materials, financial and industrial sectors are all picking up," said Steve Roukis, an analyst at fund manager Matrix Asset Advisors, which has shares in GE. Last year, GE bought Vivendi Universal, merging it with NBC to form NBC Universal.
