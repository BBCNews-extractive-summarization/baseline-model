Asian governments and international agencies are reeling at the potential economic devastation left by the Asian tsunami and floods. World Bank president James Wolfensohn has said his agency is "only beginning to grasp the magnitude of the disaster" and its economic impact. The tragedy has left at least 25,000 people dead, with Sri Lanka, Thailand, India and Indonesia worst hit. Some early estimates of reconstruction costs are starting to emerge. Economists believe several of the 10 countries hit by the giant waves could see a slowdown in growth. "The economic impact of it will certainly be large, but it should not be enough to derail the momentum of the region in 2005," he said. India's economy, however, is less likely to slow because the areas hit are some of the least developed. Thailand's Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra has estimated the destruction at 20bn baht ($510m). Thailand's fishing and real estate sectors also will be affected by Sunday's 9.0 magnitude earthquake, which sent huge waves from Malaysia to Africa. Rapid rebuilding will be key to limiting the impact of the tragedy.
