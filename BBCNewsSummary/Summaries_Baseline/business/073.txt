Germany's economy shrank 0.2% in the last three months of 2004, upsetting hopes of a sustained recovery. The Federal Statistics Office said growth for the whole of 2004 was 1.6%, after a year of contraction in 2003, down from an earlier estimate of 1.7%. Germany has been reliant on exports to get its economy back on track, as unemployment of more than five million and impending cuts to welfare mean German consumers have kept their money to themselves. The effect has been to depress prospects for the 12-nation eurozone as a whole, as well as Germany. The ECB's mandate is to fight rising prices by boosting interest rates - and that could further threaten Germany's hopes of recovery.
