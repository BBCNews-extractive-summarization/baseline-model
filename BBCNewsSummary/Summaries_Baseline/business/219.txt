Shares in struggling German football club Borussia Dortmund slipped on Monday despite the club agreeing a rescue plan with creditors on Friday. In addition to the interest-payment freeze, Borussia Dortmund also will get short-term loans to help pay salaries. Borussia officials met with almost all the banks involved in its financing on Friday and over the weekend. On 14 March, one of these creditors - property investment fund Molsiris which owns the club's stadium - holds its AGM at which it will discuss the rescue plan. Borussia Dortmund also is facing calls to appoint executives from outside the club. Adding to its woes, Borussia Dortmund was beaten 5-0 by Bayern Munich on Saturday.
