French consumers increased their spending by 1.5% in January, a figure which bodes well for the country's economic growth, figures revealed. The National Statistic Institute (INSEE) added that consumer spending in January rose 3.8% on a year-on-year basis. The INSEE also said that French consumer prices fell 0.6% in January, but were up 1.6% on an annual basis. Despite the general increase in spending in January, French households bought fewer cars in January. Consumer spending fuelled France's economic growth in the last quarter of 2004 and analysts expect that it will continue to support the economy.
