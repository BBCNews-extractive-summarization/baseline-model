Traders at US banking giant Citigroup are facing a criminal investigation in Germany over a controversial bond deal. Citigroup said it would continue to co-operate fully with the authorities. "We are disappointed that the BaFin has referred to the prosecutor the question of whether action should be brought against individuals involved," Citigroup said. However, under German criminal law, prosecutors cannot pursue Citigroup itself. Germany's financial watchdog BaFin told BBC News it had now transferred the investigation to the public prosecutor. Some Citigroup operations elsewhere in the world came under regulatory criticism in 2004. Its private banking operation in Japan was closed down by regulators in Tokyo after an "aggressive sales culture" led the bank to flout anti-money laundering rules.
