India has cleared a proposal allowing up to 100% foreign direct investment in its construction sector. Analysts say improving India's infrastructure will boost foreign investment in other sectors too. The Indian government's decision has spread good cheer in the construction sector, according to some Indian firms. A spokesman for DLF Builders, Dr Vancheshwar, told the BBC this will mean "better offerings" for consumers as well as builders. The government hopes its new policy will create employment for construction workers, and benefit steel and brick-making industries. Previously foreign investors had to develop a much larger area, discouraging some from entering the Indian market. However, Chittabrata Majumdar, general secretary of the Centre of Indian Trade Unions (CITU), said allowing FDI in the country is compromising India's own "self reliance".
