Shares in Europe's leading reinsurers and travel firms have fallen as the scale of the damage wrought by tsunamis across south Asia has become apparent. More than 23,000 people have been killed following a massive underwater earthquake and many of the worst hit areas are popular tourist destinations. But the disaster has little impact on stock markets in the US and Asia. Insurers and reinsurance firms were also under pressure in Europe. Shares in Munich Re and Swiss Re - the world's two biggest reinsurers - both fell 1.7% as the market speculated about the cost of rebuilding in Asia. Worries about the size of insurance liabilities dragged European shares down, although the impact was exacerbated by light post-Christmas trading. "It's still too early for concrete damage figures," Swiss Re's spokesman Floiran Woest told Associated Press. The unfolding scale of the disaster in south Asia had little immediate impact on US shares, however. Singapore Airlines dropped 2.6%. Malaysia's budget airline, AirAsia fell 2.9%. However, the overall impact on Asia's largest stock market, Japan's Nikkei, was slight. Shares fell just 0.03%. The Indonesian rupiah lost as much as 0.6% against the US dollar, before bouncing back slightly to trade at 9,300. In India, where more than 2,000 people are thought to have died, the rupee shed 0.1% against the dollar Analysts said that it was difficult to predict the total cost of the disaster and warned that share prices and currencies would come under increasing pressure as the bills mounted.
