Shares in Google have fallen 6.7% after employees and early investors in the web search took advantage of the first chance to sell their holdings. Google shares have risen since but fell $12.33 on Tuesday to close at $172.55. Selling the shares could turn many of Google's workers into millionaires. However, analysts say they expected most shareholders would be holding back from selling all their shares immediately, as Google's good performance and future growth potential means demand will hold. In its first earnings report since floating on the stock market, Google said it made a net profit of $52m in the three months ending 30 September.
