Strong growth in subscriptions to mobile phone network Orange has helped boost profits at owner France Telecom. Increased take-up of broadband telecoms services also boosted France Telecom's profits, which showed a 5.5% rise to 18.3bn euros ($23.4bn; Â£12.5bn). France Telecom is to spend 578m euros on buying out minority shareholders in data services provider Equant. France Telecom, one of the world's largest telecoms and internet service providers, saw its full-year sales rise 2.2% to 47.2bn euros in 2004. Orange enjoyed strong growth outside France and the United Kingdom - its core markets - swelling its subscriber base to 5.4 million. France Telecom is consolidating its interest in Equant, which provides telecoms and data services to businesses. France Telecom said it would fund the deal by selling an 8% stake in telephone directory company PagesJaunes.
