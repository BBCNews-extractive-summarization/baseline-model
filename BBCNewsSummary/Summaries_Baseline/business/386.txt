Shares in Krispy Kreme Doughnuts have taken a dunking on Wall Street after the firm revealed it would have to restate its 2004 financial reports. Krispy Kreme said accounting errors had forced the move, adding that its board of directors made the decision to restate its accounts on 28 December. Shares in Krispy Kreme sank 14.87% - or $1.83 - to close at $10.48 on the news. Krispy Kreme said the latest adjustments involved the way it accounted for the repurchase of three franchise restaurants. In a further blow, the firm said it had been advised that some of its franchise owners were not in compliance with their loan agreements, and warned it might need to borrow extra money if it was required to honour agreements on franchisee debts or operating leases. Krispy Kreme added that it had enough cash to fund its current operations, but it could not borrow any more under its existing agreements. The announcement is the latest blow for the one-time darling of Wall Street, which has lost 80% of its stock value in just over a year.
