Japanese communications firm Softbank has widened losses after heavy spending on a new cut-rate phone service. The service, launched in December and dubbed "Otoku" or "bargain", has had almost 900,000 orders, Softbank said. The firm, a market leader in high-speed internet, had an operating loss for the three months to December of 7.5bn yen ($71.5m; Â£38.4m). Its recent return to a high profile came with the purchase of Japan Telecom, the country's third-biggest fixed-line telecoms firm.
