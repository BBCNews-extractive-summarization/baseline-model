The majority owner of embattled Russian oil firm Yukos has sued the Russian government for $28.3bn (Â£15.2bn). The Kremlin last year seized and sold Yukos' main production arm, Yugansk, to state-run oil group Rosneft for $9.3bn to offset a massive back tax bill. Group Menatep, the Gibraltar-based holding company which controls 51% of Yukos, says this was illegal. The Russian government's argument for selling Yuganskneftegaz - the unit's full name - was that Yukos owed more than $27bn in back taxes for the years from 2000 onwards. "We have warned the Russian government about their continuing attacks against Yukos, its personnel and its shareholders and we have warned any buyer of Yuganskneftegaz that they would face a lifetime of litigation," said Tim Osborne, a director of Group Menatep. Menatep said the value of its Yukos shareholding had gone from $17.8bn to "virtually nothing" since 2003 as a result of the Russian government's action, as its shares have fallen 97%. "Russia has said in the past that it is bound by it, so as to attract foreign investors," he said. Yukos is still waiting to see what will happen to its filing in a US court for bankruptcy protection. Yukos claims its downfall was punishment for the political ambitions of its founder Mikhail Khodorkovsky.
