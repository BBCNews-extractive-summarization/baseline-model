Chinese police have detained three top executives at milk firm Yili, with reports suggesting that they are being investigated for embezzlement. The company, China's third-largest milk producer, is to hold an emergency meeting to debate the issue. The official Xinhua News Agency said the arrest was linked to alleged embezzlement. The company and its two main rivals - market leader Mengniu Dairy and second place Bright Dairy - dominate a Chinese milk market that has grown by almost 30% over the past five years. Analysts wondered if the scandal at Yili - the latest to befall Chinese companies this year - could be followed by further revelations of corporate wrongdoing.
