More than 800,000 Britannia Building Society members are to receive a profit share worth on average £52 each. Members of the UK's second largest building society will share £42m, with 100,000 receiving a windfall of more than £100. Last year, Britannia members shared £42m, but the average payment was only £38. Britannia has also stopped making payments to members if they are worth less than £5. Britannia will unveil its results on Wednesday.
