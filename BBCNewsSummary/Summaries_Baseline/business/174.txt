Yangtze Electric Power, the operator of China's Three Gorges Dam, has said its profits more than doubled in 2004. Sales surged to 6.2bn yuan, from 3bn yuan a year earlier. Yangtze Electric has been expanding its output to meet demand driven by China's booming economy. Earlier this month, work was halted on an underground power station, and a supply unit on the Three Gorges Dam, as well as a power station on its sister Xiluodu dam because of environmental worries. The Three Gorges Dam project has led to more than half a million people being relocated and drawn criticism from environmental groups and overseas human rights activists. Its sister project, the Xiluodu Dam, is being built on the Jinshajiang - or "river of golden sand" as the upper reaches of the Yangtze are known.
