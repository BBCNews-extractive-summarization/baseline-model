News Corp, the media company controlled by Australian billionaire Rupert Murdoch, is eyeing a move into the video games market. According to the Financial Times, chief operating officer Peter Chernin said that News Corp is "kicking the tyres of pretty much all video games companies". Video games are "big business", the paper quoted Mr Chernin as saying. The success of products such as Sony's Playstation, Microsoft's X-Box and Nintendo's Game Cube have boosted demand for video games. And with their price tags reflecting the heavy investment by development companies, video games are proving almost as profitable as they are fun. Activision has a stock market capitalisation of about $2.95bn (Â£1.57bn), compared to EA's $17.8bn. France's Ubisoft, one of Europe's biggest video game publishers, has been trying to remain independent since Electronic Arts announced plans to buy 19.9% of the firm.
