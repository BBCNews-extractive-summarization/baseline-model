A US defence and telecommunications company has agreed to pay $28.5m after admitting bribery in the West African state of Benin. At the time, Titan was trying to get a higher price for a telecommunications project in Benin. The SEC had accused Titan of illegally paying $2.1m to an unnamed agent in Benin claiming ties with President Kerekou. Prosecuting attorney Carol Lam said: "All US companies should take note that attempting to bribe foreign officials is criminal conduct and will be appropriately prosecuted." Under the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, it is a crime for American firms to bribe foreign officials.
