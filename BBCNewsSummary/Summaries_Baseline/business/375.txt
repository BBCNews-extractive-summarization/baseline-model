South Korea's largest credit card firm has averted liquidation following a one trillion won ($960m; Â£499m) bail-out. LG Card had been threatened with collapse because of its huge debts but the firm's creditors and its former parent have stepped in to rescue it. LG Card has seven million customers and its collapse would have sent shockwaves through the country's economy. "LG Card will not need any more financial aid after this," Laah Chong-gyu, executive director of Korea Development Bank - one of the firm's creditors - said. South Korea's consumer credit market has been slowly recovering from a crisis in 2002 when a credit bubble burst and millions of consumers fell behind on their debt repayments. South Korea's stock exchange can delist any firm if its debt exceeds its assets two years running.
