European leaders say Asian states must let their currencies rise against the US dollar to ease pressure on the euro. But now Europe says the euro has had enough, and Asia must now share some of the burden. "Asia should engage in greater currency flexibility," said French finance minister Herve Gaymard, after a meeting with his German counterpart Hans Eichel. Markets responded by pushing the euro lower, in the expectation that the rhetoric - and the pressure - is unlikely to ease ahead of a meeting of the G7 industrialised countries next week.
