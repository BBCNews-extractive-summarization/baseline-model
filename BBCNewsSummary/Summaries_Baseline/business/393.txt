Laura Ashley is parting company with its chief executive Ainum Mohd-Saaid. Her departure will come into effect on 1 February and follows the departure of co-chief executive Rebecca Navarednam on 1 January. In a statement issued on Thursday, Laura Ashley thanked Ms Mohd-Saaid for her services to the company. Laura Ashley, which is due to issue its next trading statement in the next few weeks, has in recent months been hit by reports of poor sales. Laura Ashley, which floated on the London Stock Exchange for Â£200m ($376m) in 1995, is majority-owned by Malaysia entrepreneur Dr Khoo Kay Peng. "Laura Ashley is a bit of a shrivelled husk of a company," said retail analyst Nick Bubb of Evolution Securities. Laura Ashley was founded by its late namesake in Kent in 1955, before moving to Mid Wales in 1961 where it still has its main UK factory.
