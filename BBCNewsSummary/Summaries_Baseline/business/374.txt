The US dollar hovered close to record lows against the euro on Friday as concern grows about the size of the US budget deficit. Analysts predict that the dollar will remain weak in 2005 as investors worry about the state of the US economy. The Bush administration's apparent unwillingness to intervene to support the dollar has caused further concern. The dollar was trading at $1.3652 versus the euro on Friday morning after hitting a fresh record low of $1.3667 on Thursday. Disappointing business figures from Chicago triggered the US currency's weakness on Thursday. "There are no dollar buyers now, especially after the Chicago data yesterday," said ABN Amro's Paul Mackel.
