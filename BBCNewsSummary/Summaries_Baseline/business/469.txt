Turkey has agreed a draft proposal with the International Monetary Fund to borrow $10bn (Â£5.19bn), extending its ongoing financial support until 2007. Turkey's current $18.6bn loan agreement with the IMF expires in February and the new deal would see it receive added support between 2005 and 2007. However, Turkey has a huge debt burden - already owing $23bn to the IMF - while its current account deficit has swelled to $10.7bn this year. The Turkish economics minister, Ali Babacan, said the two sides had reached general agreement on a new three year funding program. The agreement would also enable Turkey to defer payments on previous loans worth $3.7m until 2006. The EU will decide on 17 December whether to begin entry talks with Turkey. The US, the largest of the IMF's 184 members, is a strong supporter of continued financial support for Turkey.
