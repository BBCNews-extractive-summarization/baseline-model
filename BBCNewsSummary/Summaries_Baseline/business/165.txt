US economic growth accelerated in the third quarter, helped by strong consumer spending, official figures have shown. The increase reflected the biggest jump in consumer spending in a year. Friday's growth estimate is one of the last significant pieces of economic data before the 2 November presidential election. "It's a pretty good growth rate, but it may not be good enough to create enough jobs," said Robert Brusca, chief economist at Fact and Opinion Economics in New York. However, President Bush is expected to point to Commerce Department figures showing that consumer spending grew at 4.6% in the third quarter, up from just 1.6% in the second, as evidence that his policies are generating solid growth. Consumer spending accounts for about two thirds of all economic activity in the US. The weaker than expected growth figure makes it less likely that the US Federal Reserve will raise interest rates next month, economists said.
