The UK government will have to raise taxes or rein in spending if it wants to avoid breaking its "golden rule", a report suggests. According to NIESR, if the government's current economic cycle runs until March 2006 then it is "unlikely" the golden rule will be met. Should the cycle end a year earlier, then the chances improve to "50/50". Earlier this month, accountancy firm Ernst & Young said that Chancellor of the Exchequer Gordon Brown's forecasts for tax revenues were too optimistic. A Treasury spokesperson dismissed the latest claims, saying it was "on track to meeting spending rules and the golden rule in the current cycle and beyond". Other than its warning on possible tax hikes, the NIESR report was optimistic about the state of the UK and global economy. Hinting at better times for UK exporters, NIESR said the euro zone "is expected to pick up speed". Growth in Britain also is set to accelerate, it forecast. The main cloud on the horizon, NIESR said, was the UK's much analysed and fretted over property market.
