Choking traffic jams in Beijing are prompting officials to look at reorganising car parking charges. The trouble is that the high status of car ownership is matched by expensive fees at indoor car parks, making motorists reluctant to use them. Mr Wang, who is in charge of collecting car parking fees, said his team would be looking at adjusting parking prices to close the gap. Indoor parking bays can cost up to 250% more than outdoor ones. It wants them to use public transport, and is considering jacking up the prices of car parks near sports grounds. Indoor parking may be costly, but it is not always secure.
