The board of Indian conglomerate Reliance has agreed a share buy-back, to counter the effects of a power struggle in the controlling family. The buy-back is a victory for chairman Mukesh Ambani, whose idea it was. The company plans to buy back 52 million shares at 570 rupees (Â£6.80; $13) apiece, a premium of more than 10% to its current market price.
