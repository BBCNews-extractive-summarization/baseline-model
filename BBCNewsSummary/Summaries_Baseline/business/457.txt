German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder has called for radical reform of the EU's stability pact to grant countries more flexibility over their budget deficits. The current EU rules limit the size of a eurozone country's deficit to 3% of GDP. Countries which exceed the threshold are liable to heavy fines by the European Commission, although several countries, including Germany, have breached the rules consistently since 2002 without facing punishment. Mr Schroeder - a staunch supporter of the pact when it was set up in the 1990s - said exemptions were now needed to take into account the cost of domestic reform programmes and changing economic conditions. "Only if their competences are respected will the member states be willing to align their policies more consistently with the economic goals of the EU." The proposed changes would make it harder for the European Commission to launch infringement action against any state which breaches the pact's rules. A number of EU finance ministers are believed to favour only limited changes to the eurozone's rules.
