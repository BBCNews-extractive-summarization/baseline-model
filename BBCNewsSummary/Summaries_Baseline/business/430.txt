Sales of hybrid cars in the US are set to double in 2005, research suggests. Carmakers are starting to build hybrid sports utility vehicles (SUVs), the four-wheel-drive vehicles which now dominate the US car market. At the Detroit Motor Show, a range of manufacturers are prominently displaying their hybrid credentials. In April it will launch a hybrid version of its Highlander SUV, with an SUV from its luxury Lexus marque due later in the year. Honda has three hybrids on the market, and between them the two Japanese carmakers sold more than 80,000 units last year. Ford, which has sold 4,000 of its first hybrid since its launch in August, is bringing a hybrid SUV - the Mariner - to market a year ahead of schedule, with plans for three more models by 2008. GM has a hybrid pickup on the market and is showing two concept SUVs in Detroit. Nissan has bought Toyota's hybrid technology, but plans to bring out its first model only in 2006. "We will not be surprised by any acceleration or deceleration in the hybrid market."
