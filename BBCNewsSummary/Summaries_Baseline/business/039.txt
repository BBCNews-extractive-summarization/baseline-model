Italy's Illva Saronno has agreed to buy 33% of Changyu, the largest wine maker in China. Chinese wine sales are growing, the US Agriculture Department said, with wine sales in 2003 up 25% at 61.1bn yuan. China is encouraging state-owned companies to sell shares to foreign investors. Anheuser-Busch, Heineken and Scottish & Newcastle have all invested in the Chinese beer industry in the last two years and now Illva Saronno is betting on the Chinese wine market. The consumption of wine in China is still low, at just 0.22 litres per capita, said the US Agriculture Department.
