Companies fail to draw up plans to cope with HIV/Aids until it affects 20% of people in a country, new research says. Nearly 9,000 business leaders in 104 countries were surveyed for Business and HIV/AIDS: Commitment and Action? The WEF report shows that despite the fact that 14,000 people contract HIV/Aids every day, concern among businesses has dropped by 23% in the last 12 months. Nor could over 65% of the business leaders surveyed say or estimate the prevalence of HIV among their staff. One company that does have a plan is Anglo-American, the international mining company, which estimates an HIV prevalence of 24% among its 130,000-strong Southern African workforce. "Effective action on HIV/Aids is synonymous with good business management and leads to more profitable and sustainable operations," said Brian Brink, senior vice-president, health, at Anglo-American. "Companies should encourage all workers to know their HIV status, making it as routine as monitoring blood pressure or cholesterol," he said. Across sub-Saharan Africa, even in countries with an HIV prevalence of 10-19%, only around 7% of companies have formal HIV/Aids policies in place, according to the report. The WEF report concludes that businesses need to understand their exposure to HIV/Aids risks and come up with good local practices to manage them.
