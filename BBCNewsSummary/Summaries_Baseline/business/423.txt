Israel has asked a US banker and former International Monetary Fund director to run its central bank. Stanley Fischer, vice chairman of banking giant Citigroup, has agreed to take the Bank of Israel job subject to approval from parliament and cabinet. Mr Fischer, who speaks fluent Hebrew, will have to become an Israeli citizen to take the job. While teaching at the Massachussetts Institute of Technology he spent a month seconded to the Bank of Israel in 1979, beginning a long-time involvement in studying Israel's economy. At the World Bank in 1985, he participated in drawing up an economic stabilisation package for Israel.
