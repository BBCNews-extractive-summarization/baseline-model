Profits at Indian drugmaker Dr Reddy's fell 93% as research costs rose and sales flagged. The firm said its profits were 40m rupees ($915,000; Â£486,000) for the three months to December on sales which fell 8% to 4.7bn rupees. Patents on a number of well-known products are due to run out in the near future, representing an opportunity for Dr Reddy, whose shares are listed in New York, and other Indian generics manufacturers. Sales in Dr Reddy's generics business fell 8.6% to 966m rupees. Dr Reddy's Indian competitors are gathering strength although they too face heavy competitive pressures.
