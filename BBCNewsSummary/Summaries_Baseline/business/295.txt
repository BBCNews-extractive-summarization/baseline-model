Business confidence among Japanese manufacturers has weakened for the first time since March 2003, the quarterly Tankan survey has found. December's confidence level was below that seen in September, the Bank of Japan said. In the Bank of Japan's December survey, the balance of big manufacturers saying business conditions are better, minus those saying they are worse, was 22, down from 26 in September. Japan's economy grew by just 0.1% in the three months to September, according revised data issued this month. The dollar's decline has strengthened the yen, making Japanese exports more expensive in the US. China's attempts to cool down its fast-growing economy have also hit Japanese industry's sales abroad. Nonetheless, Japanese firms have been stepping up capital investment, and the survey found the pace is quickening.
