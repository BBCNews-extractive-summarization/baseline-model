Air Deccan has signed a deal to acquire 36 planes from Avions de Transport Regional (ATR). Recently, India's first low-cost airline ordered 30 Airbus A320 planes for $1.8bn. Under the agreement, Air Deccan will buy 15 new ATR 72-500 and lease another 15. Filippo Bagnato, ATR's chief executive, has said that his firm will also work with Air Deccan to create a training centre in Bangalore. Air Deccan has said it will base its business model on European firms such as Ireland's Ryanair. India's government has given its backing to cheaper and more accessible air travel.
