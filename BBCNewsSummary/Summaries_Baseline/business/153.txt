Prices of homes in the UK rose a seasonally adjusted 0.5% in February, says the Nationwide building society. The annual rate has halved since August last year, as interest rises have cooled the housing market. Nationwide said that in January house prices went up by 0.4% on the month and by 12.6% on a year earlier. In November, Barclays, which owns former building society the Woolwich, forecast an 8% fall in property prices in 2005, followed by further declines in 2006 and 2007. And last summer, economists at PricewaterhouseCoopers (PWC) warned house prices were overvalued and could fall by between 10% and 15% by 2009. The price of an average UK property now stands at Â£152,879. Homeowners now expect house prices to rise by 1% over the next six months, Mr Bannister said. House prices have risen 0.9% this year, Nationwide said, and if this pace of increase persists, prices would rise by just under 6% in the year to December. Further evidence of a slowdown in the housing market emerged from Bank of England lending figures released on Tuesday.
