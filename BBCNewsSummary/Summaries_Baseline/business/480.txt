Wipro, India's third-biggest software firm, has reported a 60% rise in profit, topping market expectations. Wipro offers services such as call centres to foreign clients and has worked for more than half of the companies on the Fortune 500 list. Wipro said demand was strong, allowing it to increase the prices it charged. One problem identified by Wipro was the high turnover of its staff. Wipro is majority owned by India's richest man Azim Premji.
