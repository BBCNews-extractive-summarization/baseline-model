Next has said its annual profit will be Â£5m lower than previously expected because its end-of-year clearance sale has proved disappointing. "Clearance rates in our end-of-season sale have been below our expectations," the company said. Next chief executive Simon Wolfson admitted that festive sales were "below where we would expect a normal Christmas to be", but said sales should still top analyst expectations. Next's like-for-like store sales in the five months from 3 August to 24 December were up 2.9% on a year earlier. Overall sales across both its retail and mail order divisions were up 12.4%, Next said. Its Next Directory mail order division saw sales rise 13.4% during the five-month period. However, one dealer, who asked not to be named, told Reuters the seasonal sales performance was "not what people had hoped for".
