The gap between US exports and imports has widened to more than $60bn (Â£31.7bn), an all-time record. Part of the expanding deficit came from high prices for oil imports. The trade deficit - far bigger than the $54bn widely expected on Wall Street - prompted a rapid response from the currency markets. The main catalyst, most economists accept, is the large budget deficit on the one hand, and the current account deficit - the difference between the flow of money in and out of the US - on the other. The trade deficit is a large part of the latter. One small bright spot for US policy-makers was a slight decline in the deficit with China, often blamed for job losses and other economic woes. Although China's overall trade surplus is expanding, according to Chinese government figures, the Commerce Department revealed the US's deficit with China was $19.6bn in November, down from $19.7bn the month before. But the deficit with Japan was at its worst in more than four years.
