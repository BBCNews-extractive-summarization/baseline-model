Shares in Continental Airlines have tumbled after the firm warned it could run out of cash. Continental also said that, if it did not make any cuts, it expects to lose "hundreds of millions of dollars" in 2005 in current market conditions. Failure to make cutbacks may also push it to reduce its fleet, the group said. "Without the reduction in wage and benefit costs and a reasonable prospect of future profitability, we believe that our ability to raise additional money through financings would be uncertain," Continental said in its filing to the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Houston-based Continental now has debt and pension payments of nearly $984m which it must pay off this year.
