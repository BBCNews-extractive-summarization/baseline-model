Venezuela is to review all foreign investment in its mining industries in an effort to strengthen its indigenous industrial output. President Hugo Chavez has ordered all existing contracts with foreign firms to be examined to see if they provide maximum benefits to the country. Chavez has sought to extend the state's role in all sectors of the economy. He has argued that major economic reforms are vital to improve the lives of Venezuela's poorest citizens. Venezuela has previously assured foreign companies with operations in the mineral rich country that it respects existing contracts. Companies from the United States, Canada, France and Switzerland all have substantial investments in Venezuela's mining sector.
