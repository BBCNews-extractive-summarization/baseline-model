Air Deccan has ordered 30 Airbus A320 planes in a $1.8bn (Â£931m) deal as India's first low-cost airline expands in the fast-growing domestic market. Air Deccan was set up last year and wants to lure travellers away from the railway network and pricier rivals. Beer magnate Vijay Mallya recently set up Kingfisher Airlines, while UK entrepreneur Richard Branson has said he is keen to start a local operation. India's government has given its backing to cheaper and more accessible air travel. Infrastructure is being built to handle the expected increase in demand and on Tuesday, Agence France Presse reported that a group led by Germany's Siemens won the contract to build a private airport near Bangalore. For its part, Air Deccan, set up by army officer and silk farmer Gorur Gopinath, plans to increase its fleet to 60 aircraft within five years.
