The battle for control of Manchester United has taken another turn after the club confirmed it had received a fresh takeover approach from US business tycoon Malcolm Glazer. No formal offer has been made yet, but Manchester United have confirmed they have received a "detailed proposal" from the US entrepreneur which could lead to a bid. A previous approach to the United board by Mr Glazer in October last year was turned down. Mr Glazer's previous offer involved borrowing large amounts of money to finance any takeover. While United's board may be casting a serious eye over Mr Glazer's latest proposals, supporters remain fiercely opposed to any deal. Supporters' group Shareholders United - which has proved adept in rallying opposition to Mr Glazer's campaign - said it would fight any move. "Manchester United are a debt-free company. Mr Glazer owns 28.1%. "If that's the case then Mr Glazer might well secure their support - if he does, this bid could well go ahead." Malcolm Glazer was little-known in the UK until he started to build up his stake in Manchester United in late 2003. No bid emerged, but Mr Glazer continued to increase his holding in the club. In October 2004, Manchester United said they had received a "preliminary approach", which turned out to have come from Mr Glazer. At the club's annual general meeting in November, Mr Glazer took revenge by using his hefty stake in the club to oust three directors from the board.
