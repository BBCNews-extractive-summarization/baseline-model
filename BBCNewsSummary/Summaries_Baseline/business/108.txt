US industrial production increased for the 21st month in a row in February, but at a slower pace than in January, official figures show. "February was another good month in the manufacturing sector," said ISM survey chairman Norbert Ore.

"While the overall rate of growth is slowing, the overall picture is improving as price increases and shortages are becoming less of a problem. Of the 20 manufacturing sectors surveyed by ISM, 13 reported growth. The ISM's index of national manufacturing activity is compiled from the responses of purchasing executives at more than 400 industrial companies.
