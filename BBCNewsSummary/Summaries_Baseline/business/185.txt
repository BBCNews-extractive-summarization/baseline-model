The Bank of America has revealed it has lost computer tapes containing account details of more than one million customers who are US federal employees. The bank gave no details of how the records disappeared, but said they had probably not been misused. Customers' accounts were being monitoring and account holders would be notified if any "unusual activity" was detected, bank officials said. Bank of America said the tapes went missing in December while being shipped to a back-up data centre. But although there was no evidence of criminal activity, the bank said, the Secret Service - a federal agency whose brief includes investigations of serious financial crime - is said to be looking into the loss.
