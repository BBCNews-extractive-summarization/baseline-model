Bob Murray, chairman of Sunderland FC, has launched a Â£1.5m ($2.8m) bid for the club after buying broadcaster BSkyB's stake in the business. Mr Murray is already Sunderland's leading shareholder, holding a 37.6% stake, and now hopes to take full control of the Championship side. Sunderland delisted its shares from the stock market in August. A lifetime Sunderland supporter and board director since 1984, Mr Murray agreed to buy BSkyB's 4.76% holding in the Wearside club on Tuesday - taking his stake to 42.3%. "The recent speculation surrounding Malcolm Glazer and Manchester United has shown the unsettling effect possible where there are a number of disparate interests," he added. Sunderland were relegated from the Premiership in 2003 but are currently pushing for promotion. BSkyB bought its stake in Sunderland in 1999 as part of a five year media partnership deal.
