Pan-European stock market Euronext has approached the London Stock Exchange (LSE) about a possible takeover bid. Talks with the European stock market and with rival bidder Deutsche Boerse will continue, the LSE said. LSE saw its shares surge 4.9% to a new high of 583p in early trade, following the announcement on Monday. The offer follows widespread media speculation that Euronext would make an offer for LSE. Commentators say that a deal with Euronext, which owns the Liffe derivatives exchange in London and combines the Paris, Amsterdam and Lisbon stock exchanges, could potentially offer the LSE more cost savings than a deal with Deutsche Boerse. However, Euronext said it could not guarantee "at this stage" that a firm offer would be made for LSE.
