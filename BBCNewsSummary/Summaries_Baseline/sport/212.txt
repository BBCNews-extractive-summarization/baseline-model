The worst kept secret in Scottish football was revealed on Thursday when Walter Smith was named as the new national manager. But is Smith the man for what must be one of the hardest jobs in football? Scotland are not blessed with quality players with experience at the top level, so Smith will have to get the best out of meagre resources. Characters like Souness, Ferguson and current Ibrox manager Alex McLeish all cite Smith's experience and his expansive knowledge of the Scottish game. That will certainly not be the case with Smith. Smith will inherit the same problems Vogts had - a callow squad of players with no exceptional talents. And it remains to be seen if Smith will experience the rash of call-offs that blighted so much of Vogts' preparation work. A fresh start for the Scottish national team was imperative and Smith is widely regarded as a safe pair of hands.
