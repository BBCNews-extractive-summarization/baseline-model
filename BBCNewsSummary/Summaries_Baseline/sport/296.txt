France coach Bernard Laporte believes his team will be scared going into their game with England on Sunday, but claims it will work in their favour. "We will go to Twickenham with a little fear and it'll give us a boost," said the French coach. Meanwhile, Perpignan centre Jean-Philippe Granclaude is delighted to have received his first call-up to the France squad. Laporte will announce his starting line-up on Wednesday at the French team's training centre in Marcoussis, near Paris.
