England forward Martin Corry says Jason Robinson is the right man to lead the national team back to winning ways. After losses to Wales and France, critics have started to wonder whether Robinson can captain from full-back. But Corry has backed Robinson, who was given the role after the injury to fly-half Jonny Wilkinson, ahead of this weekend's trip to Ireland. Every week my respect for him goes up," Corry told BBC Radio Five Live. "He is an inspirational captain. It's an honour to be in the England side and an honour to play under him." England are under immense pressure following their poor start to the year and victory is vital if they are to rescue their Six Nations campaign. But Corry insists England are in the right frame of mind for the contest. "We have not performed but if we put in a performance on Sunday then we can start turning results around. A trip to Lansdowne Road is daunting at any time, especially against an Ireland side that are flying high after two impressive wins. But Corry is relishing the prospect of taking on the Irish in their own backyard.
