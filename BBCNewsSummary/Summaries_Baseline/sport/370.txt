England rugby union captain Jason Robinson has targeted dual code success over Australia on Saturday. Robinson, a former rugby league international before switching codes in 2000, leads England against Australia at Twickenham at 1430 GMT. "Beating the Aussies in both games would be a massive achievement, especially for league," said Robinson. "They have a great opportunity to land a trophy and it would be a massive boost for rugby league in this country if we won," said Robinson. But Robinson was not losing sight of the task facing his England side in their final autumn international. Robinson also revealed that the union side had sent the Great Britain team a good luck message ahead of the showdown in Leeds. "We signed a card for them today and will write them an email on Saturday wishing them all the best," said Robinson.
