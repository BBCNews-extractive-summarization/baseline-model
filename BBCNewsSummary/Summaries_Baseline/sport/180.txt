- Brentford boss Martin Allen: "After conceding eight goals in our last three matches, I have to admit I'm not very confident. "Southampton have just drawn with the Premiership champions and that makes our task harder than it was already." - Southampton boss Harry Redknapp: "We know they can give us problems. "Brentford have done well but we are the Premiership side and should have the better players. KEY MATCH STATS 
 - BRENTFORD are the lowest ranked club left in the FA Cup. Victory over Premiership strugglers Southampton, would bring the mighty Manchester United to Griffin Park and a gigantic pay day for the sole League One survivors. Southampton striker Henri Camara scored twice from close range to put the Saints in command, but Isaiah Rankin hit back just before half time, and Sam Sodje headed past a creaky defence on 58 minutes. - The Londoners have conceded six goals in their two subsequent League outings - three each in losing away to Hartlepool and drawing at home to Sheffield Wednesday. - SOUTHAMPTON go into this tie on the back of an eventful Premiership match with Arsenal on Saturday. The retention of their ever present Premier League status must be the number one priority, irrespective of the rewards that success against Brentford would bring. But to write another chapter in their FA Cup history, the Solent side must avoid succumbing to lower division opposition for the first time since Rotherham, from the second level, beat them 2-1 in a third round tie at Millmoor on 16 January 2002. Fulham were then in the Second Division, when they won a third round replay at Craven Cottage 1-0 on 13 January 1999.
