England tight-head prop Phil Vickery has been ruled out of the rest of the 2005 RBS Six Nations after breaking a bone in his right forearm. Vickery was injured as his club side, Gloucester, beat Bath 17-16 in the West country derby on Saturday. Barkley will have a scan on Sunday and might miss England's trip to Six Nations leaders Ireland next weekend. Robinson is already without World Cup winners Jonny Wilkinson, Will Greenwood, Mike Tindall, Richard Hill and Trevor Woodman through injury. Vickery has broken the radius, a large bone in his forearm. Bath prop Matt Stevens is the only remaining tight-head in England's training squad and could be involved against Ireland. Fly-half Andy Goode is also a strong contender for the match-day 22 after an immaculate kicking display on Saturday.
