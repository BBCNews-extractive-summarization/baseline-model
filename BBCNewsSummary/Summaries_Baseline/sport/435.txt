Sania Mirza continued her remarkable rise with victory over US Open champion Svetlana Kuznetsova at the Dubai Championships on Tuesday. The 18-year-old Indian, who is already a huge star in her home country, won 6-4 6-2 in front of a delirious crowd. It was Mirza's sixth straight victory following her first WTA tournament win in Hyderabad last month. Earlier, Daniela Hantuchova built on her improving form with a 7-6 6-2 win over sixth seed Alicia Molik. Mirza needed attention to an ankle injury after the second game against Kuznetsova. "I really didn't expect that after my ankle turn," said Mirza. Mirza plays Silvia Farina Elia or Jelena Jankovic next. Seventh seed Nathalie Dechy and Elena Bovina were among other first-round winners on Tuesday.
