Jennifer Capriati has become the third leading lady to withdraw from the Australian Open because of injury. It comes as a blow to the women's draw as last year's champion, Justin Henin-Hardenne, and runner-up, Kim Clijsters, will also be absent. Capriati also decided against competing in the Australian Open warm-up event, the Sydney International.
