Flanker Colin Charvis is unlikely to play any part in Wales' final two games of the Six Nations. Charvis has missed all three of Wales' victories with an ankle injury and his recovery has been slower than expected. Centre Parker has only a "slim chance" of being involved against the Scots on 13 March, so Luscombe's return to fitness after missing the France match with hamstring trouble is a timely boost. Replacement hooker Robin McBryde remains a doubt after picking up knee ligament damage in Paris last Saturday. Steve Jones from the Dragons is likely to be drafted in if McBryde fails to recover.
