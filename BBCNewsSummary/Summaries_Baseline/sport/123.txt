England's defensive worries have deepened following the withdrawal of Tottenham's Ledley King from the squad to face Holland. Chelsea's John Terry and Wayne Bridge are also out, leaving coach Sven-Goran Eriksson with a real problem for Wednesday's match at Villa Park. Wes Brown and Jamie Carragher are likely to be the makeshift partnership. But now he has pulled out with a bruised knee and is likely to be replaced by Carragher, alongside Brown. And Brown now looks certain to add to his tally of seven senior appearances for England.
