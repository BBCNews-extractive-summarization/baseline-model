Scarlets and USA Eagles forward Dave Hodges has ended his playing career to pursue a coaching role in the States. "Realising I would be unable to play this season, the club and I agreed to end my contract early," said Hodges. The Scarlets have begun to rebuild their squad for next season after a disappointing Heineken Cup campaign, with plenty more signings and departures expected in the coming weeks. Scarlets chief executive Stuart Gallacher confirmed that 17 of the current squad would be out of contract in the summer. Gallacher was keen to pay tribute to the role back-five forward Hodges has played at Stradey Park, though. Hodges described his years at Stradey as "the best time of my life."
