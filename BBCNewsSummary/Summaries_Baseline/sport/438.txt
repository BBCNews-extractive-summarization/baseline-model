World number one Lindsay Davenport has criticised Wimbledon over the issue of equal prize money for women. "Somebody, I think it was Mr Phillips, said they won't have money for flowers at Wimbledon. The statement added: "It was said by someone else and was a humorous aside at the end of a radio interview when the conversation had moved to talking about the Wimbledon grounds." Davenport was speaking following the announcement that this week's Dubai Duty Free event will join the US and Australian Opens in offering equal prize money for women. Serena Williams, who is also in Dubai, added: "I'm obviously for equal prize money. "Women's tennis is exciting. Men's tennis is exciting as well, but the women have it right now.
