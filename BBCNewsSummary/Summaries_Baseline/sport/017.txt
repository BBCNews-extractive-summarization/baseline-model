Kostas Kenteris' lawyer has called for the doping charges against the Greek sprinter to be dropped. Kenteris and compatriot Katerina Thanou were given provisional suspensions in December for failing to take drugs tests before the Athens Olympics. Kenteris and Thanou withdrew from the Athens Olympics last August after missing drugs tests on the eve of the opening ceremony. The lawyer added that he has proof the authorities "knew" Kenteris was in Germany at the time he was alleged to have missed a test in Chicago. Kenteris won 200m gold at the 2000 Sydney Olympics, while Thanou won silver in the 100m.
