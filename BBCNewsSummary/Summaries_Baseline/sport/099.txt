Scotland manager Walter Smith has given his backing to the reinstatement of the Home International series. But Smith said: "Bringing it back would add meaning to friendly games and that's something that's needed." The Home International series was done away with in 1984, with the traditional Scotland-England fixture continuing until 1989. That game is one Smith would be delighted to see reinstated. "England were criticised for the 0-0 draw against Holland - the way Scotland were slammed in the past for poor results in friendlies. "So I would support the return of the home internationals - the only problem would be fitting them in to the fixture schedule."
