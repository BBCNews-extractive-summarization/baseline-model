England's 1-0 defeat to Spain on Wednesday dominated the back and front pages of the country's press on Thursday. But what did the Spanish press make of the affair? BBC Sport looks at the reaction. But AS does cover the English reaction to the pre-match comments from Spain coach Luis Aragones, who highlighted Britain's colonial past when probed about his own remarks regarding Thierry Henry in October. Marca refers in passing to the booing of England's black players - but only after referring to the cheers of "ole" which greeted the long periods of Spanish possession. Aragones' "no comment" to questions about racism after the match is also highlighted, as Marca focuses on the Spanish coach's praise for his players. Elsewhere, the Spanish media criticises its English counterparts for stoking up the racism issue. This hasn't happened in the Spanish league and Spain for many years," said Spanish Federation press officer Fernando Garrido. And Spanish daily ABC accuses English reporters of launching a witch-hunt against Aragones. "What the boy in the Bernabeu did was odd... Rooney seemed intent to kick any Spanish player who approached him." Marca's headline says it all: "Wayne Rooney se volvi&#243; loco en el Bernab&#233;u (Wayne Rooney became crazy in the Bernabeu)" Rooney's display alarms the writer, in particular three "chilling" fouls on Joaquin, Casillas and Marchena, which "could well have left them in the infirmary." And like AS, Marca criticises Gary Neville for "leaving a message on Reyes' ankle" to remind him of the Manchester United-Arsenal clash this month.
