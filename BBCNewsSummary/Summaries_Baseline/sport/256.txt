Everton defender David Weir has played down talk of European football, despite his team lying in second place in the Premiership after beating Liverpool. Weir told BBC Radio Five Live: "We don't want to rest on our laurels and say we have achieved anything yet. He said: "We are looking after each other and hard work goes a long way in this league. "Also injuries and suspensions haven't cost us too badly and we have a lot of self-belief around the place."
