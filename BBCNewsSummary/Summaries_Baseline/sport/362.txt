The Wales Students rugby side has become a casualty of the Welsh Rugby Union's reorganisation at youth level. But that move has seen the WRU decide to end its funding of representative sides such as Wales Students. The Welsh Students Rugby Football Union feels that it is unable to properly prepare for or stage the matches. Players who have played for Wales Students before going on to win full senior representative honours include Robert Jones, Rob Howley, Jon Humphreys, Darren Morris, Martyn Williams and Ceri Sweeney.
