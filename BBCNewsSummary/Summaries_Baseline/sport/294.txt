Wasps made light of the absence of several internationals to sink London Irish with a trio of second-half tries. Tom Voyce powered through the Irish defence for Wasps' second try before Richard Birkett went over unchallenged. Wasps piled on the pressure in an attempt to grab a fourth try which would have secured them a bonus point, but they were denied by some desperate defending from Irish. Director of rugby Warren Gatland revealed that harsh words at half-time inspired his Wasps side to raise their game after the restart. London Irish coach Gary Gold felt the result exposed his side's lack of consistency. Irish trailed by just two points at the break and Gold said: "For 55 minutes we lived with the best but we have got to get back for the full 80 minutes." "We've got a good chance but with Leeds facing possible relegation they're going to come out firing," he added.
