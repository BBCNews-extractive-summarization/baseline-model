Jade Johnson is undecided about whether to contest next month's European Indoor Championships in Madrid despite winning the AAAs long jump title on Saturday. "I don't want to go if I am not going to get a medal," said Johnson. Johnson, who finished seventh in last year's Olympic Games, has not competed indoors since 2000. "It's the stress," said Johnson. Johnson next competes in the high-class Birmingham Grand Prix on 18 February.
