Wales secured their first away win in the RBS Six Nations for nearly four years with a six-try victory in Rome. Fly-half Stephen Jones added four conversions as Wales maintained their superb start to this year's tournament. Wales twice threatened further scores but failed to find the crucial pass, and Italy hit back out of the blue in the 11th minute. With the Welsh line-out stuttering and Italy twice turning the visitors' scrum, the home side's forward power brought them back into it. Wales regained control with a second try in the 21st minute, Henson lobbing up a high kick to the left corner where Shanklin jumped higher than Nitoglia to dot down his 15th Test try. Jones was unable to convert and De Marigny then hit the upright with a penalty attempt for Italy. Henson was also narrowly short with a long-range effort at goal, but Wales ended the half with a vital third score to give themselves some breathing space. Italy, who lost flanker Mauro Bergamasco with a head knock before half-time, built up a head of steam on the resumption. But Wales put the outcome beyond doubt with two superb tries in four minutes before the hour. Before Italy could recover from that blow, a strong surge from Gareth Thomas and great off-loads from Martyn Williams and replacement Kevin Morgan saw Shane Williams scamper over. With Jones converting both for a 33-8 lead, Wales had the luxury of sending on five more replacements for the final quarter. The only downside for Wales was a hamstring injury suffered by Luscombe.
