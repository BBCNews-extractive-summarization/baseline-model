Manchester City striker Nicolas Anelka has issued an apology for criticising the ambitions of the club. Anelka was quoted in a French newspaper as saying he would like to play in the Champions League for a bigger club. But chairman John Wardle said: "I've spoken to Nicolas and he's apologised for anything that might have been mistakenly taken from the French press. The club still owe French club PSG £5m from the purchase of Anelka in May 2002. But Wardle added: "There's been no bids for Nicolas Anelka. No-one has come to me and said I would like to buy Nicolas Anelka. "If a bid comes in for Nicolas Anelka I will speak to the board and then speak to Kevin Keegan. Wardle did stress that the club was not inviting any offers for England winger Shaun Wright-Phillips. He added: "I've no intention of selling Shaun Wright-Phillips. City recently announced debts of £62m, but Wardle confirmed they would try and find funds to bring in players in the January transfer window.
