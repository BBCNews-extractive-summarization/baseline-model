The FA is to take action after trouble marred Wednesday's Carling Cup tie between Chelsea and West Ham. Police in riot gear were confronted by a section of the West Ham support after the match which the Blues won 1-0. Chelsea assistant boss Steve Clarke said: "I would rather talk about the football but we think it was something thrown from the crowd. West Ham boss Alan Pardew said: "It's a shame because I thought there was good English banter in the crowd. Lampard's spot-kick was saved to the delight of the Hammers' fans, who have still not forgiven him for leaving Upton Park. Fans are also thought to have clashed outside the ground after the game. The FA is already looking into the trouble at Tuesday's heated Carling Cup tie between Millwall and Liverpool.
