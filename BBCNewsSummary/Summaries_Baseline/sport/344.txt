Number eight Imanol Harinordoquy has been dropped from France's squad for the Six Nations match with Ireland in Dublin on 12 March. Harinordoquy was a second-half replacement in last Saturday's 24-18 defeat to Wales. Bourgoin lock Pascal Pape, who has recovered from a sprained ankle, returns to the 22-man squad. Rougerie hurt his chest against Wales while Grandclaude was a second-half replacement against both England and Wales. France coach Bernard Laporte said Harinordoquy had been axed after a poor display last weekend. France, who lost to Wales last week, must defeat the Irish to keep alive their hopes of retaining the Six Nations trophy.
