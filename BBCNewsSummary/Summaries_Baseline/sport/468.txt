Tim Henman opened his 2005 campaign with a 6-1 7-5 victory over Argentine David Nalbandian at the Kooyong Classic exhibition tournament on Wednesday. The British number one will next play Roger Federer at the Australian Open warm-up event on Friday. The world number one beat Gaston Gaudio 5-7 6-1 6-4, before Andre Agassi saw off Chilean Olympic gold medalist Nicolas Massu 6-1 7-6 (7-4). Andy Roddick beat Ivan Ljubicic, who replaced Paradorn Srichaphan, 6-1 6-4. Henman made an impressive start to the year, only faltering against Nalbandian when serving for the match at 5-4. "It's a great start to the year - just what I was looking for," Henman told his website. Henman also revealed the extent of the back problems he suffered in the off-season. Federer dropped a tight first set against 2004 French Open champion Gaudio, but was content with his game. Agassi was delighted with victory over Massu in his first match for over two months.
