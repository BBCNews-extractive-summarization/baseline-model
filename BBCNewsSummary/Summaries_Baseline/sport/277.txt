Martin O'Neill hopes to block Stilian Petrov's call-up by Bulgaria during Celtic's busy festive programme. The Celtic manager does not view the friendly against Valenciana - a region of Spain - on 28 December as important. "We will have to speak with the Bulgarian FA. Bulgaria's game comes between Celtic's Boxing Day meeting with Hearts and their 2 January fixture against Livingston. "I have said this before, but Bulgaria are the one nation who seem to organise a lot of friendly games."
