What have the European Indoor trials told us? Well, I think we could be heading to the European Championships with half a dozen medal prospects. It was good to see athletes beginning to make steps forward, to see a few new faces and there were lots of personal bests kicking around. The best performance on the track for me was Sarah Claxton's win in the 60m hurdles. Running sub-eight seconds twice in a week puts her right up there and if she repeats that in Madrid she will be close to picking up a medal. Diane Allahgreen has been our best hurdler for some time now and I think she was surprised to be beaten by Sarah. In fact, the men's 60m hurdles is so strong, I think the selectors will pick three hurdlers to go to Madrid. He is such a huge talent but just needs some consistency - and if he does that then the big jumps will get even further. Kelly will be up against Carolina Kluft in the pentathlon at the European Championships but she has every chance of a medal on the basis of what we've seen so far. I thought both the 60m races were disappointing in different ways. In the women's race, Jeanette Kwayke was hoping to run against defending champion Joice Maduaka. Janine Whitlock competed well in the pole vault on her return following a two-year drugs ban. But the most disappointing thing in the wider view is that she is our best pole vaulter by a long way and that shouldn't be the case. The event has moved on immensely since Janine has been away and if there was more domestic competition I think that would help her. He came to Britain as a high jumper but damaged his toe, started doing more running and found his talent.
