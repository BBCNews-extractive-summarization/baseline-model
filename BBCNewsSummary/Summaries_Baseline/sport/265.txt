Jesper Gronkjaer has agreed a move to Atletico Madrid from Birmingham City. The 27-year-old winger spent just five months at St Andrews following a £2.2m move from Chelsea in July after playing for Denmark at Euro 2004. He is set to move during the January transfer window in a deal rumoured to be about £1.4m, subject to a medical. "We will meet with the player's representative to finalise the contract and decide when he will sign," said Atletico sporting director Toni Munoz. Boss Steve Bruce had said that he would be happy to let the Danish international go if the price was right.
