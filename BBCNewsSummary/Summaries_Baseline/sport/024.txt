Susan Chepkemei has decided she is fit enough to run in next month's Great Edinburgh International Cross Country. Race director Matthew Turnbull said: "Susan will add even more strength in depth to the world-class line up." Recently-crowned European cross country champion Briton Hayley Yelling also competes in Edinburgh on 15 January, as does in-form Scot Kathy Butler.
