Former Scotland international Finlay Calder fears civil war at the SRU could seriously hamper his country's RBS Six Nations campaign. And Calder said: "This is terrible news for every level of Scottish rugby. "He has been driven out by people who seem happier waging civil war than addressing the central issue that professional rugby can't be run by amateurs," said Calder. "But I don't believe the rest of the SRU will take this lying down. He thought the work of Scotland's coaches, who have been attempting to arrest the decline of the national side, would be made much more difficult. said Calder. Why do so many Scots have this knack of turning on each other when the going gets tough?"
