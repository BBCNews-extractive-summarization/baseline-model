London Marathon organisers are hoping that banned athlete Susan Chepkemei will still take part in this year's race on 17 April. "We are watching it closely," said London race director David Bedford. The 29-year-old has finished second to Paula Radcliffe in the 2002 and 2003 London races as well as in November's New York City marathon.
