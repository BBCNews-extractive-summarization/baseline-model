Chelsea's William Gallas believes they will battle it out with Arsenal for the Premiership in the coming months. "It'll be a two-horse race all the way to the end of the season because we are both going to give it everything," he told BBC Sport. You need a bit of both but it will be as hard for the Arsenal players as it is for the Chelsea boys." "We know that we have got the power in our hands just now," added Gallas. "We will be challenging to come first as much as every Arsenal player will be challenging to come first." Gallas has been given extra confidence by the impact manager Jose Mourinho has had since taking over as manager during the summer. And the French international defender believes Mourinho is perfectly suited to boss the squad of Chelsea stars and says his managerial expertise will prevent any player revolt.
