Wales coach Mike Ruddock has made two changes from the team that beat Italy 38-8 for Saturday's trip to France. Thomas, a try-scorer in Rome, drops down to the bench instead of Ian Gough, while Cardiff back Rhys Williams steps up in place of Morgan. However, the experienced and in-form Morgan was already pushing hard for a start at Stade de France. Wales have beaten France on two of their last three visits to Paris, and another victory this time around would keep them firmly on course for a first Five or Six Nations title triumph since 1994. "Graham Henry (former Wales coach) said a couple of years ago that we should 'be bold' when going to France, and he was proved right," said Ruddock.
