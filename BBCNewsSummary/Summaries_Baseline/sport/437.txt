Andrew Murray will become Britain's youngest-ever Davis Cup player after it was confirmed he will play in the doubles against Israel on Saturday. Murray will eclipse the record set by Roger Becker back in 1952. Murray is the brightest young hope in British tennis, after winning the US Open junior title last year and the BBC Young Sports Personality of the Year. British number one Tim Henman, who announced his Davis Cup retirement earlier this year, believes Britain can win the tie in Tel Aviv. But Henman urged Bogdanovic, who has had run-ins with British tennis officials in the past, to seize his chance.
