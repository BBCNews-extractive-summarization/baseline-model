Adriano's agent Gilmar Rinaldi has insisted that he has had no contact with Chelsea over the striker. Chelsea were reported to have made inquiries about Inter Milan's 22-year-old Brazilian star. Rinaldi told BBC Sport from Rio de Janeiro: "I can assure you that Chelsea have had no dealings whatsoever with either me or Adriano. And Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho had claimed that he was in Milan talking to Adriano on the day he is alleged to have held a clandestine meeting with Arsenal defender Ashley Cole. Rinaldi told BBC Sport: "I have to say that nobody from Chelsea or any other London club has contacted me. "If Chelsea are interested then they must make an offer." But Rinaldi said: "I cannot give you a price that Inter would accept for Adriano.
