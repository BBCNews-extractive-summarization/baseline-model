Tottenham manager Martin Jol acclaimed his players for their patience in their 3-0 FA Cup fifth-round victory over a determined Nottingham Forest side. It was a professional sort of performance," the Dutchman said. Looking ahead to the quarter-final, Jol said: "Newcastle have got a very good side and they are always difficult." Robbie Keane, skipper for the night and scorer of the crucial second goal, echoed his manager's sentiments on the last-eight match. He conceded the win over Forest, which included goals from Noe Pamarot and Mido, was not pretty to watch. "We dug in and the gaffer said to us at half-time to keep being patient and that the goal will come." Forest manager Gary Megson conceded his team did not deserve anything after a poor performance.
