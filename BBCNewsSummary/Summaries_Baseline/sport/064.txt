James McIlroy stormed to his second international victory in less than a week, claiming the men's 800m at the TEAG indoor meeting in Erfurt. McIlroy is now hoping to gain a late entry into Sunday's international indoor meeting in Leipzig. After three successive wins over the past fortnight, McIlroy is brimming with confidence. On Friday, McIlroy delivered an impressive run despite suffering from his bad cold. McIlroy set a world-leading mark for 1,000m at the Sparkassen Cup in Stuttgart last weekend.
