Manchester City's Paul Bosvelt will find out "within a month" whether he is to be offered a new one-year deal. The 34-year-old Dutch midfielder is out of contract in the summer and, although his age may count against him, he feels he can play on for another season. They promised me an answer within the next month so I am waiting to see," he said. Bosvelt joined City from Feyenoord in 2003 and at first he struggled to adapt to life in England.
