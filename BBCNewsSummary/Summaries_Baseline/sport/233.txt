Southampton are set to unveil Harry Redknapp as their new manager at a news conference at 1500 GMT on Wednesday. Redknapp, 57, quit his Fratton Park position on 24 November and vowed: "I will not go down the road - no chance." Pompey coach Kevin Bond is poised to join Redknapp, who will be Saints' third boss of the season. Portsmouth chairman Milan Mandaric said he was "disappointed" by the news and claimed Redknapp had been in talks with Southampton for "some time". According to Mandaric, Redknapp vowed he would not join their South coast rivals when he left Portsmouth. Redknapp became a cult hero after leading Portsmouth into the Premiership for the first time, and then masterminding their survival in their debut season. When Redknapp's appointment is confirmed, he will be Saints' ninth manager in eight years.
