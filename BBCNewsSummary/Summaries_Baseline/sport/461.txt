Greg Rusedski has criticised the governing body of men's tennis for not releasing contamination-free supplements in time for the new season. Rusedski said: "I tried to order some but didn't receive any and I haven't got any yet. The British number two escaped a possible ban last year when he persuaded a tribunal that a positive doping test was the result of contaminated ATP supplements. In response, the ATP struck a deal with pharmaceutical company GlaxoSmithKline to provide contamination-free drinks and nutritional bars for the men's tour. David Higdon, Vice President of the ATP, admitted: "I agree with Greg. "The good thing is that there is now a 100% guarantee, so hopefully all this will never happen again," said Rusedski.
