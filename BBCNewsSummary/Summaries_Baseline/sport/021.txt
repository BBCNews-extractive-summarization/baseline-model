Kenya's athletics body has suspended two-time London Marathon runner-up Susan Chepkemei from all competition until the end of the year. Athletics Kenya (AK) issued the ban after Chepkemei failed to turn up for a cross country training camp in Embu. "We have banned her from all local and international competitions," said AK chief Isaiah Kiplagat. But the ban will prevent the two-time world half-marathon silver medallist from challenging Radcliffe at this year's London event in April. But AK maintained it was making an example of Chepkemei as a warning to other Kenyan athletes. KA has also threatened three-time women's short-course champion Edith Masai with a similar ban if reports that she feigned injury to avoid running at the cross country world championships are true.
