Kelly Holmes has been chosen for both the 800m and 1500m at next month's European Indoor Championships - despite not yet confirming her availability. But UK Athletics chief Max Jones believes it is likely Holmes will race. If Holmes does take her place in the GB side, she has already indicated that 1500m will be her favoured distance. Jones added: "She was pleased with her run in Birmingham (at last weekend's Grand Prix). And he admitted Holmes' presence would be a great boost to the rest of the Norwich Union GB team. Defending 60m champion Jason Gardener is included and will be chasing his third successive gold medal. Kelly Sotherton has been invited by championship organisers to compete against Carolina Kluft in the pentathlon. The championships will be the last to be attended by Jones before he retires to be succeeded by Dave Collins. Jones said: "The Olympic Games is the overwhelming target for UKA and therefore it is beneficial to start the next four-year cycle with a not-so-pressurised major games.
