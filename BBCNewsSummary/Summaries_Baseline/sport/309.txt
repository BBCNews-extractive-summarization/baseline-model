That's what I call a tough game. It was very physical and fair play to the Italians they made us work very hard for our victory. It is by far the strongest Italian team that we have faced. We knew all along that we would be a huge threat particularly the first game in the Championship. It was really hard work out there and the players have plenty of bumps and bruises to prove it. It was great work by Brian and I always knew I had scored even though it went upstairs to the video referee. Eddie (O'Sullivan) was very calm at half-time even though we were only 8-6 ahead. That new ruck law made it a bit more difficult to get out of our own half. Every one was a little down after the game following the injuries to Brian and Gordon. It's a big ask after such a bruising encounter. I was very impressed the way the Scots played against the French on Saturday.
