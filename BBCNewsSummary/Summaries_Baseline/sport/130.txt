Larne's teenage star Robbie Weir is poised to join Sunderland after turning down a move to Stoke City. "I heard on Sunday that he has joined Sunderland, but not from the lad himself," he said. ''Robbie has an agreement with Larne that he can negotiate with interested clubs. But it would be great to see him making it at Sunderland.''
