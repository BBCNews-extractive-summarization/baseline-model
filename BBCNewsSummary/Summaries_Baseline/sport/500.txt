Tim Henman has retired from Great Britain's Davis Cup team. The 30-year-old, who made his Davis Cup debut in 1994, is now set to fully focus on the ATP Tour and on winning his first Grand Slam event. Henman added that he was available to help Britain in its bid for Davis Cup success, with the next tie against Israel in March . Henman leaves Davis Cup tennis with an impressive record, having won 36 of his 50 matches. "Tim has quite simply had a phenomenal Davis Cup career and it has been an absolute privilege to have captained the team with him in it," said Bates. While it's a great loss I completely understand and respect his decision to retire from Davis Cup and focus on the Grand Slams and Tour. " "Looking to the future this decision obviously marks a watershed in British Davis Cup tennis but it is also a huge opportunity for the next generation to make their mark. Henman made his Davis Cup debut in 1994 against Romania in Manchester. Henman and Britain had little luck in Davis Cup matches until 1999 when they qualified for the World Group.
