Paula Radcliffe has been granted extra time to decide whether to compete in the World Cross-Country Championships. "There is no question that Paula would be a huge asset to the GB team," said Zara Hyde Peters of UK Athletics. Radcliffe must make a decision by Tuesday - the deadline for team nominations. British team member Hayley Yelling said the team would understand if Radcliffe opted out of the event. Radcliffe was world cross-country champion in 2001 and 2002 but missed last year's event because of injury.
