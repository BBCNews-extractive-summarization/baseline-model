Sprinter Michelle Collins has received an eight-year ban for doping offences after a hearing at the North American Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS). Collins' ban is a result of her connection to the federal inquiry into the Balco doping scandal. The US Anti-Doping Agency (USADA) decided to press charges against Collins in the summer. "The USADA has proved, beyond a reasonable doubt, that Collins took EPO, the testosterone/epitestosterone cream and THG," said a CAS statement. "Collins used these substances to enhance her performance and elude the drug testing that was available at the time." World record holder Tim Montgomery is also facing a lifetime ban after being charged by the USADA. USADA chief executive officer Terry Madden said the action taken against Collins was further proof of that.
