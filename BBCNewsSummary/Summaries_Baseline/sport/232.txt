Glenn Hoddle has been unveiled as the new Wolves manager. The ex-England coach has been given a six-month contract to succeed Dave Jones, who was sacked after the club's poor start to the season. Hoddle, who will work alongside Stuart Gray, has been out of the game since he was sacked by Spurs in 2003. Gray, who has been caretaker manager, was assistant boss when Hoddle was manager at Southampton. "I'm delighted to be here," said Hoddle. "Stuart Gray has done a fantastic job as caretaker manager. Wolves chief executive Jez Moxey defended the decision to give Hoddle a short-term contract. Hoddle began his managerial career as player-boss with Swindon before moving on to Chelsea and then taking up the England job. The 47-year-old later returned to management with Southampton, where he again succeeded Jones - as he has now done at Wolves. Wolves are currently 17th in the Championship and have a home game against Millwall on Tuesday.
