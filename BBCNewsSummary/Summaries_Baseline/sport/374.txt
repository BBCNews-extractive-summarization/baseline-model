Hong Kong is hoping to join Japan as co-host of the 2011 Rugby World Cup. Japan has applied to host the tournament on its own, with the aim of taking it outside rugby's traditional strongholds for the first time. But Hong Kong Rugby Football Union (HKRFU) chairman John Molloy has called for the territory to host one of the pools and a quarter-final. Japan faces stiff competition in the form of South Africa and New Zealand to host the event in seven years' time. "Until now, the World Cup has been held in countries from the Six Nations or Tri-Nations," said Tokumasu. "Japan is ready to host the tournament and we are looking forward to welcoming the world of rugby to Japan."
