Ireland maintained their Six Nations Grand Slam ambitions with an impressive victory over Scotland at Murrayfield. Hugo Southwell's try gave the Scots an early 8-0 lead but scores from locks Malcolm O'Kelly and Paul O'Connell put the visitors in command by half-time. Jon Petrie scored a second try for Scotland but late scores from John Hayes and Gavin Duffy sealed victory. Scotland will try to give their coach Matt Williams a first Six Nations victory when Italy come to Edinburgh, but they again struggled to turn pressure into points. A powerful charge from flanker Jason White was carried on by Ali Hogg and when Ireland conceded a penalty close to their own line, Scotland kicked it to touch. The Irish defence foiled the home side on that occasion, but a stray hand in a ruck allowed Paterson to stroke over a penalty in the eighth minute. Ireland got themselves on the scoreboard with an O'Gara penalty and by the 24th minute the visitors were ahead. But Ireland still delivered a hammer blow to Scotland's hopes just before the interval. Scotland suffered a further blow on the resumption when Ireland flanker Johnny O'Connor won another vital turnover, and O'Gara's basketball pass sent Hickie over in the left corner. Scotland looked bereft of ideas but a half-break from Paterson sparked them back to life just before the hour. But it proved a false dawn, and Ireland reasserted their authority in the final 10 minutes.
