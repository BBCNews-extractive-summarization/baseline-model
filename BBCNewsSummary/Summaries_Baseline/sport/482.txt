Andy Roddick is reportedly close to confirming US Davis Cup assistant Dean Goldfine as his new coach. Roddick ended his 18-month partnership with Brad Gilbert on Monday, and Goldfine admits talks have taken place. "I think Andy wants a long-term relationship and wants to make sure it's the right fit... the best fit." Martin is the other name to have been linked to the vacant post alongside Roddick.
