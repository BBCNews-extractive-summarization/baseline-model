Pole vaulter Yelena Isinbayeva broke her own indoor world record by clearing 4.89 metres in Lievin on Saturday. In the men's 60m, former Olympic 100m champion Maurice Greene could only finish second to Leonard Scott. "I ran my race perfectly," said Scott, who won in 6.46secs, his best time indoors.
