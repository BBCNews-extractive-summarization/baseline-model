Arsenal's Brazilian midfielder Edu has hit out at the club for stalling over offering him a new contract. Edu's brother and representative Amadeo Fensao has previously said that Arsenal's current offer to the midfielder was well short of what he was seeking. "There is a meeting planned for 6 or 7 January to sort it out with Arsenal. Edu is now able to begin negotiations with other clubs because Fifa regulations allow players to start talks six months before their contracts expire. Edu said: "I've just heard stories from the news that the Madrid president Florentino Perez, the Valencia people, as well as Barcelona are interested. Last month Wenger said he we was hopeful Edu would sign a new deal and played down suggestions that the lure of a club like Real Madrid would be too strong for Edu. Edu added that he had been encouraged by Wenger's support for him.
