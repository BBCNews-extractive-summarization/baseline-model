Simon Taylor has been named in the Scotland squad for Saturday's Six Nations clash with Italy. Taylor suffered knee ligament damage playing against Ireland in Dublin in the 2004 Six Nations championship. "Simon is one of Scotland's truly world class players so it is a huge bonus," said team-mate Chris Paterson. Taylor has turned out for English side Saracens in recent weeks during a short-term loan to improve his fitness. So Taylor played the last 20 minutes of Saracens' win over Northampton and then 40 minutes in a friendly against South African Super 12 side The Cats.
