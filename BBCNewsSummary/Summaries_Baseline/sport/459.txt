Roger Federer reached the last four of the Qatar Open with an easy 6-1 6-2 win over seventh seed Feliciano Lopez. Federer, who lost in the quarter-final in his last Qatar appearance in 2003, was happy with his form. Lopez showed glimpses of resolve early in the second set when he held his first service game and came close to breaking Federer. Spaniard Costa will next face Croatian Ivan Ljubicic after the sixth seed beat Rafael Nadal 6-2 6-7 (3/7) 6-3.
