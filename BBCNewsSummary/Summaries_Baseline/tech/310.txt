Net browser Opera 8.0, due for official release at the end of next month, will be "the most accessible browser on the market", according to its authors. The latest version of the net browser can be controlled by voice command and will read pages aloud. Opera can also magnify text by up to 10 times and users can create "style sheets", its developers say. "Our mission was always to provide the best internet experience for everyone," said Opera spokeswoman, Berit Hanson. The company points out that this will also appeal to anyone using Opera with a handheld device. Unlike commercially available voice recognition software, Opera does not have to be "trained" to recognise an individual voice. Opera is free to download but a paid-for version comes without an ad banner in the top right hand corner and with extra support. Opera began life as a research project - a spin-off from Norwegian telecoms company Telenor.
