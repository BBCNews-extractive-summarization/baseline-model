Robots are learning lessons on "robotiquette" - how to behave socially - so they can mix better with humans. By playing games, like pass-the-parcel, a University of Hertfordshire team is finding out how future robot companions should react in social situations. "Our mission is to look at how such a robot should be programmed to respect personal spaces of humans." The research also focuses on human perception of robots, including how they should look, and how a robot can learn new skills by imitating a human demonstrator. "Without such studies, you will build robots which might not respect the fact that humans are individuals, have preferences and come from different cultural backgrounds," Professor Dautenhahn told BBC News Online. To find out how they would react, the Hertfordshire Cogniron team taught one robot to play pass-the-parcel with children. "If you think of a robot as a companion for the human being, you can think of 20 years into the future," concluded Professor Dautenhahn.
