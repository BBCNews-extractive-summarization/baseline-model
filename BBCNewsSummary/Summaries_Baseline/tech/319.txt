The world is casting its gaze on the Cell processor for the first time, but what is so important about it, and why is it so different? The technology inside the Cell is being heralded as revolutionary, from a technical standpoint. The Cell technology, on the other hand, uses multiple Cell processors linked together to run lots of calculations simultaneously. The speed of computer memory has been slowly increasing over the last few years, but the memory technology that accompanies the Cell is a huge leap in performance. Perhaps more important than any of the technology is the Cell's role in the imminent "war on living rooms". By creating a radically new architecture, and using that architecture in a games console that is sure to be a huge seller, they hope that the Cell processor can become the dominant technology in the living room, shutting out their rivals. Cell is, in fact, specifically designed to be deployed throughout the house. Sony hopes to put Cells in televisions, kitchen appliances and anywhere that could use any sort of computer chip. Each Cell will be linked to the others, creating a vast home network of computing power. This digital home of the future depends on the widespread adoption of the Cell processor and there are, as with all things, a number of reasons it could fail. You can also guarantee that Microsoft and Intel are not going to sit around and let Cell take over home computing without a fight. Intel will be furiously working on new designs that address the problems of its current chips to create a rival technology to Cell, so that it doesn't lose its desktop PC dominance. If Cell succeeds in becoming the living room technology of choice, however, it could provide the jump-start to the fully digital home of the future.
