The US Federal Bureau of Investigation is warning that a computer virus is being spread via e-mails that purport to be from the FBI. The messages warn that their internet use has been monitored by the FBI's Internet Fraud Complaint Center. An attachment in the e-mail contains the virus, the FBI said. It is not clear what the virus does once it has infected a computer. "Recipients of this or similar solicitations should know that the FBI does not engage in the practice of sending unsolicited e-mails to the public in this manner," the FBI said in a statement.
