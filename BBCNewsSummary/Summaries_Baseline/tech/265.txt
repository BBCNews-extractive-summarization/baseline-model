Multimedia mobile phones are finally showing signs of taking off, with more Britons using them to go online. Figures from industry monitor, the Mobile Data Association (MDA), show the number of phones with GPRS and MMS technology has doubled since last year. By the end of 2005, the MDA predicts that 75% of all mobiles in the UK will be able to access the net via GPRS. About 53 million people own a mobile in the UK, so the figures mean that half of those phones use GPRS. With more services being offered by mobile operators, people are finding more reasons to go online via their mobile. Multimedia messaging services also looked brighter with 32% of all mobiles in the UK able to send or receive picture messages. But a recent report from Continental Research reflects the continuing battle mobile companies have to actually persuade people to go online and to use MMS. It said that 36% of UK camera phone users had never sent a multimedia message, or MMS.
