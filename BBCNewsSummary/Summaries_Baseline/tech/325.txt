As mobile phones move closer to being a ubiquitous, all-in-one media player, audio is becoming ever more important. The sound of a buzzing bee jumps from left to right before disappearing around the back of my head. The surround sound demo is unremarkable when heard on a multi-speaker home cinema system but startling when emerging from a small mobile phone. British firm Sonaptic is one of a number of companies to have developed 3D audio technology that emerges from stereo speakers. But Sonaptic's managing director David Monteith says his firm is the only company to offer positional 3D audio on a mobile. "There are quite a few basic technologies out there, making the sound seem a bit bigger, headphones a bit nicer. "No-one has really tried before to make proper 3D positional audio - where an individual channel can be moved around." Sonaptic has been working with Japanese mobile network NTT DoCoMo to set standards for 3D audio on mobile phones. The structure of the ear works as a 3D encoder for sound - helping the brain understand from where sound is emanating. Sonaptic's audio processing algorithms mimic that 3D encoding, giving the impression that sound is coming from the left, right, and behind a listener when in fact it is coming from a single source. "The shape of your ear causes differences in sound from one ear to the other. Sonaptic hopes the technology will have a big impact in the growing market of mobile gaming and music downloading. Sonaptic offers its technology on a chip or in software and is about to release a new version which significantly improves the efficiency of the audio processing.
