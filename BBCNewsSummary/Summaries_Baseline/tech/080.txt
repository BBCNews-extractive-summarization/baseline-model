A fresh delay has hit controversial new European Union rules which govern computer-based inventions. The draft law was not adopted by EU ministers as planned at a Brussels meeting on Monday during which it was supposed to have been discussed. The fresh delay came after Polish officials had raised concerns about the law for the second time in two months. Critics say the law would favour large companies over small ones and could impact open-source software innovation. In December, Poland requested more time to consider the issue because it was concerned that the law could lead to the patenting of pure computer software. The EU says the law would bring Europe more in line with how such laws work in the US, but this has caused some angry debate amongst critics and supporters. Critics say a similar model in Europe would hurt small software developers which do not have the legal and financial might of larger companies.
