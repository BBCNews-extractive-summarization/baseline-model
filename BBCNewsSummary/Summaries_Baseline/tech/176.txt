A brother and sister in the US have been convicted of sending hundreds of thousands of unsolicited e-mail messages to AOL subscribers. It is the first criminal prosecution of internet spam distributors. They were convicted under a state law that bars the sending of bulk e-mails using fake addresses. A third defendant, Richard Rutkowski, was acquitted. Jaynes was also found guilty of breaking a state law which prohibits the sending of more than 100,000 e-mails in 30 days, Virginia State Attorney General Jerry Kilgore reportedly said. But Jaynes' lawyer David Oblon called the nine-year recommended term "outrageous" and said his client believed he was innocent. Spam messages are estimated to account for at least 60% of all e-mails sent.
