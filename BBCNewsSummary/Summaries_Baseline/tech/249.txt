A 22-year-old gamer has spent $26,500 (Â£13,700) on an island that exists only in a computer role-playing game (RPG). The Australian gamer, known only by his gaming moniker Deathifier, bought the island in an online auction. The land exists within the game Project Entropia, an RPG which allows thousands of players to interact with each other. Entropia allows gamers to buy and sell virtual items using real cash, while fans of other titles often use auction site eBay to sell their virtual wares. Deathifier will make money from his investment as he is able to tax other gamers who come to his virtual land to hunt or mine for gold. The Entopia economy lets gamers exchange real currency into PED (Project Entropia Dollars) and back again into real money.
