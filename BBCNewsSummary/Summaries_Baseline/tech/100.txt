Leading British computer games maker Peter Molyneux has been made an OBE in the New Year Honours list. The head of Surrey's Lionhead Studios was granted the honour for services to the computer games industry. Mr Molyneux has been behind many of the ground-breaking games of the last 15 years such as Populous, Theme Park, Dungeon Keeper and Black and White. Speaking to the BBC News website Mr Molyneux said receiving the honour was something of a surprise. Now, he said, the gaming world rivals the movie industry for sales and cultural influence. "Britain plays a big part in it," he said. Mr Molyneux said that his involvement with the games industry started almost by accident as back in the early days game making was more a hobby than a career. He left Bullfrog in 1997 to set up Lionhead Studios which was behind the ambitous and widely acclaimed game Black & White. One of the next titles to come from Lionhead puts players in charge of a movie studio and tasks them with producing and directing a hit film.
