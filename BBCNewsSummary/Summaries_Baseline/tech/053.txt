Microsoft has unveiled the finished version of its home-grown search engine. The now formally launched MSN search site takes the training wheels off the test version unveiled in November 2003. Microsoft faces challenges establishing itself as a serious search site because of the intense competition for queries. Microsoft is keen to make its home-grown search engine a significant rival to Google. The Microsoft search engine can also answer specific queries directly rather than send people to a page that might contain the answer. Tony Macklin, director of product at Ask Jeeves, pointed out that its search engine has been answering specific queries this way since April 2003. "The major search providers have moved beyond delivering only algorithmic search, so in many ways Microsoft is following the market," he said. The test, or beta, version of the MSN search engine unveiled in November had a few teething troubles.
