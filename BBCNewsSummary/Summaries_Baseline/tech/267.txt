The odds are that when you fire up your browser, you go straight to your favourite search engine, rather than type in a web address. Some may see this as the height of laziness, but in an era of information overload, search has become a vital tool in navigating the net. Over the past 12 months, giants of the technology world such as Microsoft and Yahoo have sought to grab a slice of the search action. "User experience has contributed to people searching more," said Yonca Brunini of Yahoo. But search is hardly a new phenomenon. "Search was always important," said Urs Holzle, Google vice-president of operations. "We trumpeted that in 1999. "People didn't realise that search was the future. If Microsoft sees search as important, then nobody queries it," said Mr Holzle. Microsoft is just one of the net giants muscling in on search. Web users face a plethora of choices as each company tries to outflank Google by rolling out new search products such as desktop search. Search is not just about finding your way around the web. For all these advances, search is still a clumsy tool, often failing to come up with exactly what you had in mind. In order to do a better job, search engines are trying to get to know you better, doing a better job of remembering, cataloguing and managing all the information you come across. This is perhaps the Holy Grail of search, understanding what it is you are looking for and providing it quickly.
