Spin the radio dial in the US and you are likely to find plenty of Spanish-language music. Hip-hop and rap are actually quite popular in the Spanish-speaking world, but local artists are having trouble marketing their work abroad. But now, a US company is bringing rap and hip-hop en espanol to computer users everywhere. Los Caballeros de Plan G are one of Mexico's hottest hip-hop acts. But most Mexican hip-hop fans, not to mention fans in most of the Spanish-speaking world, rarely get a chance to hear the group's tracks on the radio. "You can't really just go on the radio and listen to hip-hop in Spanish... it's just not accessible," says Manuel Millan, a native of San Diego, California. "It's really hard for the Spanish hip-hop scene to get into mainstream radio. The name says it all: it is web-based radio, devoted to the hottest Spanish language rap and hip-hop tracks. Suddenly, with the help of the website, Los Caballeros de Plan G are producing "export quality" rap. The web might be just the right medium for Spanish language hip-hop right now. "He's considered the Eminem of Argentina, and the Latin American hip-hop scene," Millan says. "He really hasn't had that much exposure as far as anywhere in the world, but he's definitely the one to look out for as far as becoming the next big thing in the Spanish-speaking world." The site has listeners from across the Spanish speaking world. Right now, Mexico leads the way, accounting for about 50% of listeners. That is not surprising as many consider Spain to be the leader in Spanish-language rap and hip-hop. Millan says that Spain is actually just behind the United States and France in terms of overall rap and hip-hop production. "It's basically him bragging that he's one of the best emcees in Spain right now," Millan says. Millan says they want to include more music and more news from the world of Spanish language hip-hop and rap.
