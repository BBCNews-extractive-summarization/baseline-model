An increasing number of firms are offering web storage for people with digital photo collections. Many people's hard drives are bulging with photos and services which allow them to store and share their pictures online are becoming popular. Search firms such as Google are also offering more complex tools for managing personal photo libraries. Photo giants such as Kodak offer website storage which manages photo collections, lets users edit pictures online and provides print-ordering services. Some services, such as Kodak's Ofoto and Snapfish, offer unlimited storage space but they do require users to buy some prints online. Marcus Hawkins, editor of Digital Camera magazine, said: "As file sizes of pictures increase, storage becomes a problem. "People are using their hard drives, backing up on CD and DVD and now they are using online storage solutions. On Tuesday, Google released free software for organising and finding digital photos stored on a computer's hard drive. Photos can then be uploaded to sites such as Ofoto. The vast majority of pictures remain on a PC's hard drive, which is why search tools, such as those offered by Google, become increasingly important.
