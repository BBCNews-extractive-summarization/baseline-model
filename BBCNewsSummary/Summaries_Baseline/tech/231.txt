Ways of ensuring that parents know which video games are suitable for children are to be considered by the games industry. It follows concerns that children may be playing games aimed at adults which include high levels of violence. And this Christmas, parents are expected to spend millions on video games and consoles. Violent games have been hit by controversy after the game Manhunt was blamed by the parents of 14-year-old Stefan Pakeerah, who was stabbed to death in Leicester in February. His mother, Giselle, said her son's killer, Warren Leblanc, 17 - who was jailed for life in September - had mimicked behaviour in the game. The issue of warnings on games for adults was raised on Sunday by Trade and Industry Secretary Patricia Hewitt. "Adults can make informed choices about what games to play. "Industry will consider how to make sure parents know what games their children should and shouldn't play." Among the possible measures could be a campaign to explain to parents that many games are made for an adult audience, as well as changes to the labelling of the games themselves.
