Two UK gamers are about to embark on a world tour as part of the most lucrative-ever global games tournament. The CPL World Tour kicks off in mid-February and the first leg will be in Istanbul. All ten bouts of the tournament will be played throughout 2005, each one in a different country. The tournament champion for each leg of the CPL World Tour will walk away with a $15,000 prize. The world tour stops are open to any keen gamer that registers. Mr Foster and Mr Treacy get the chance to attend the World Tour as members of the UK's Four-Kings gaming clan. Towards the end of 2004 Four-Kings staged a series of online Painkiller competitions to reveal the UK's top players of the PC game. "There are a lot of people who take gaming very seriously and support their local or national team with the same passion as any other sport," said Simon Bysshe who filmed the event for Four-Kings and Intel. "Professional gaming is here to stay and will only grow in popularity," he said.
