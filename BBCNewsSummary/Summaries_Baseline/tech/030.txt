A European Parliament committee has ordered a rewrite of the proposals for controversial new European Union rules which govern computer-based inventions. The Legal Affairs Committee (JURI) said the Commission should re-submit the Computer Implemented Inventions Directive after MEPs failed to back it. Supporters say it would let firms protect their inventions. The directive is intended to offer patent protection to inventions that use software to achieve their effect, in other words, "computer implemented invention". This means that the US-based Amazon.com holds a patent for its "one-click shopping" service, for example. Supporters say current laws are inefficient and it would serve to even up a playing field without bringing EU laws in line with the US.
