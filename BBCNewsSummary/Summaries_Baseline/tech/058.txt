British Telecom has said it will double the broadband speeds of most of its home and business customers. The increased speeds will come at no extra charge and follows a similar move by internet service provider AOL. Many BT customers will now have download speeds of 2Mbps, although there are usage allowances of between one gigabyte and 30 gigabytes a month. "Britain is now broadband Britain," said Duncan Ingram, BT's managing director, broadband and internet services. "These speed increases will give people the opportunity to do a lot more with their broadband connections," he said. Despite the increases, BT will continue to have usage allowances for home customers. BT now has a 36% share of the broadband market - down from 39% - which is becoming increasingly competitive. In the last few months, many rival ISPs have begun to offer 2Mbps services, including AOL, Plusnet and UK Online.
