The European Parliament has thrown out a bill that would have allowed software to be patented. During consultation the software patents bill could be substantially re-drafted or even scrapped. Hugo Lueders, European director for public policy at CompTIA, an umbrella organization for technology companies, said only when intellectual property was adequately protected would European inventors prosper. He said the benefits of the bill had been obscured by special interest groups which muddied debate over the rights and wrongs of software patents. Other proponents of the bill said it was a good compromise that avoided the excesses of the American system which allows the patenting of business practices as well as software. The latest rejection means that now the bill on computer inventions must go back to the EU for re-consideration.
