The libraries of five of the world's most important academic institutions are to be digitised by Google. Scanned pages from books in the public domain will then be made available for search and reading online. The full libraries of Michigan and Stanford universities, as well as archives at Harvard, Oxford and the New York Public Library are included. Online pages from scanned books will not have adverts but will have links to online store Amazon, Google said. There will also be links to public libraries so that the books can be borrowed. The New York library is allowing Google to include a small portion of books no longer covered by copyright. Harvard is limiting its participation to 40,000 books, while Oxford wants Google to scan books originally published in the 19th Century and held in the Bodleian Library. About one million books will be scanned by Google, less than 15% of the total collection held in the Bodleian. "This is the day the world changes," said John Wilkin, a University of Michigan librarian working with Google.
