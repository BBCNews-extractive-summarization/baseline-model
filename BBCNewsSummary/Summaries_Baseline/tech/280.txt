Cable firms NTL and Telewest have both launched video-on-demand services as the battle between satellite and cable TV heats up. "Video-on-demand will offer a deeper range of content than currently exists on TV. There will be less compromising around the TV schedule and some of the less popular channels may go by the wayside," said Philip Snalune, director of products at Telewest. Telewest customers in Bristol and NTL viewers in Glasgow will be the first to test the new service, which sees a raft of movies on offer for 24 hour rental. During the year, the service will be extended to all cable regions. In addition, NTL is offering children's programmes, adult content, music video and concerts. NTL is also offering viewers the chance to catch up with programmes they have missed. PVR has been a big success for Sky because it gives customers control over programmes. With both services on offer from Telewest, Mr Tveter is confident the cable firm can dent not just the viewing figures for terrestrial TV but also gain a huge competitive advantage over Sky. NTL said it had not ruled out the possibility of offering a PVR but for the moment is concentrating on video-on-demand. Video-on-demand has the added advantage of not requiring a separate set-top box or extra remote controls, he added. "While Sky will remain the dominant force in UK pay TV for some time to come, NTL and Telewest seem well placed to successfully ride this second wave of VOD enthusiasm and, if marketed correctly, this could help them eat into Sky's lead," he said.
