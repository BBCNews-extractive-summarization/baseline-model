One person in the UK is joining the internet's fast lane every 10 seconds, according to BT. The telecoms giant said the number of people on broadband via the telephone line had now surpassed four million. "The take-up rate for broadband is accelerating at a terrific pace," said Ben Verwaayen, BT's chief executive. Part of the surge in people signing up was due to BT stretching the reach of ADSL - the UK's most widely used way of getting broadband - beyond six kilometres. According to BT, more than 95% of UK homes and businesses can receive broadband over the phone line. There are also an estimated 1.7 million cable broadband customers in the UK.
