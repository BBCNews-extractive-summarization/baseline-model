The number of personal computers worldwide is expected to double by 2010 to 1.3 billion machines, according to a report by analysts Forrester Research. More than a third of all new PCs will be in these markets, with China adding 178 million new PCs by 2010, it said. The report comes less than a week after IBM, a pioneer of the PC business, sold its PC hardware division to China's number one computer maker Lenovo. "Instead local PC makers like Lenovo Group in China and Aquarius in Russia that can better tailor the PC form factor, price point and applications to their local markets will ultimately win the market share battle," he said. The report forecast that there will be 80 million new PC users in India by 2010 and 40 million new users in Indonesia.
