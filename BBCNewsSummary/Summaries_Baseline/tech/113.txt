Imagine editing Titanic down to watch just your favourite bits or cutting out the slushier moments of Star Wars to leave you with a bare bones action-fest. New Media for a New Millennium (NM2) will have as its endgame the development of a completely new media genre, which will allow audiences to create their own media worlds based on their specific interests or tastes. Viewers will be able to participate in storylines, manipulate plots and even the sets and props of TV shows. One of the productions will be a experimental television show where the plot will be driven by text messages from the TV audience. It is being developed in Finland and will be shown to Finnish TV audiences. "The TV at the moment is a relatively dumb box which receives signals. "At the moment we have interactive gaming and a limited form of interactive TV which usually means allowing audiences to vote on shows. "Viewers will be able to interact directly with the medium and influence what they see and hear according to their personal tastes and wishes," he said. "Media users will no longer be passive viewers but become active engagers." It will also be important that the tools are sophisticated enough to obey the complex rules of cinematography and editing said John Wyver, from TV producer Illuminations Television Limited, which is also involved in the project. "The tool has to know which bits fit together both visually, by observing the time-honoured rules that go in editing, and in terms of the story." It will allow viewers to create a so-called media world based on their own specific areas of interest such as poetry, music and architecture.
