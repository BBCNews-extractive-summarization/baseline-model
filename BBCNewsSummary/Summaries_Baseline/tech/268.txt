Computer giant IBM says 500 of its software patents will be released into the open development community. IBM described the step as a "new era" in how it dealt with intellectual property and promised further patents would be made freely available. Traditional technology business policy is to amass patents and despite IBM's announcement the company continues to follow this route. IBM was granted 3,248 patents in 2004, more than any other firm in the US, the New York Times reports. For each of the past 12 years IBM has been granted more US patents than any other company. IBM has received 25,772 US patents in that period and reportedly has more than 40,000 current patents. In a statement, Dr John E. Kelly, IBM senior vice president, Technology and Intellectual Property, said: "True innovation leadership is about more than just the numbers of patents granted. "Our pledge today is the beginning of a new era in how IBM will manage intellectual property." Stuart Cohen, chief executive of US firm Open Source Development Labs, said the move could mean a change in the way companies deal with patents. Florian Mueller, campaign manager of a group lobbying toprevent software patents becoming legal in the European Union,dismissed IBM's move as insubstantial. "Let's put this into perspective: We're talking aboutroughly one percent of IBM's worldwide patent portfolio. IBM will continue to hold the 500 patents but it has pledged to seek no royalties from the patents. Other areas covered by the patents released by IBM include storage management, simultaneous multiprocessing, image processing, networking and e-commerce.
