Consumers want music rather than movies while on the move, says a report. Produced by Jupiter Research the analysis of the portable media player market found only 13% of Europeans want to watch video while out and about. The report concluded that the driving force behind the growth of Europe's portable player market was likely to be music, rather than films or any combination of the two. "Dedicated music players are the only established digital media players in Europe today despite their high prices," said Ian Fogg, Jupiter analyst. Mr Fogg said although video players and smartphones were trying to cash in on this success they faced a tough job because of the compromises that had to be made when creating a dual-purpose device. The report showed that 27% of consumers asked are interested in portable music players. Mr Fogg said portable video players were likely to remain a niche product that would not be able to compete with devices dedicated to music playback. Now consumers face an almost overwhelming choice of high-capacity portable music players that let them store every track on every CD that they own.
