IBM is spending $100m (Â£52m) over the next three years beefing up its commitment to Linux software. IBM said the money will fund a variety of technical, research and marketing initiatives to boost Linux use. IBM said it had taken the step in response to greater customer demand for the open source software. In 2004 IBM said it had seen double digit growth in the number of customers using Linux to help staff work together more closely. Even before IBM announced this latest spending boost it was one of the biggest advocates of the open source way of working.
