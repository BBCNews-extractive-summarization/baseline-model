Movies Open Water and Saw are among those to be made available for Sony's PSP games console. Film studio Lions Gate entertainment has announced an initial list of 12 movies that will be on the UMD format used by the handheld. Already available in Japan, the PSP is released in the US on 24 March. The Punisher and House of the Dead along with older titles such as Total Recall and Rambo: First Blood, will be in the UMD format, with disks costing between $20 (£10.40) to $30 (£15.60) for new titles and $10 (£5.20) to $20 for older films. The disks, which are smaller than DVDs, only work in Sony's PSP and can hold up to 1.8GB of data. Four movies have already been announced for PSP.
