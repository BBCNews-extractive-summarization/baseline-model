Viewers could soon be rewarded for watching TV as loyalty cards come to a screen near you. Broadcasters such as Sky and ITV could offer viewers loyalty points in return for watching a particular channel or programme. Sky will activate a spare slot on set-top boxes in January, marketing magazine New Media Age reported. Loyalty cards have become a common addition to most wallets, as High Street brands rush to keep customers with a series of incentives offered by store cards. Viewers who stay loyal to a particular TV channel could be rewarded by free TV content or freebies from retail partners. "Parents could pre-pay for some content, as a kind of TV pocket money card," said Nigel Whalley, managing director of media consultancy Decipher. Credit cards that have been chipped could be used in set-top boxes to pay for movies, gambling and gaming. Loyalty cards could play a role in this, particularly in reducing the number of people who cancel their Sky subscriptions, said Ian Fogg, an analyst with Jupiter Research.
