Sony has taken the prize for top innovator at the annual awards of PC Pro Magazine. It won the award for taking risks with products and for its "brave" commitment to good design. Conferring the award, PC Pro's staff picked out Sony's PCG-X505/P Vaio laptop as a "stunning piece of engineering". Paul Trotter, news and features editor of PC Pro, said several Sony products helped it to take the innovation award. Other Sony products that helped included the Vaio W1 desktop computer and the RA-104 media server. "While not always inventing new technology itself, Sony was never afraid to innovate around various formats," said Mr Trotter. Microsoft's Media Player 10 took the award for Most Wanted Software.
